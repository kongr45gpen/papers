Formal requirements elicitation also enables the employment of analysis tools to prove important properties, such as consistency and realizability. In this paper, we present the realizability analysis framework that we developed as part of the Formal Requirements Elicitation Tool ({FRET}). Our framework prioritizes usability, and employs state-of-the-art analysis algorithms that support infinite theories. We demonstrate the workflow for realizability checking, showcase the diagnosis process that supports visualization of conflicts between requirements and simulation of counterexamples, and discuss results from industrial-level case studies.},

It is the result of an iterative definition process driven by systems and software architects working in a broad spectrum of business domains (transportation, avionics, space, radar, etc.). It enforces an approach structured on successive engineering phases which establishes clear separation between needs (operational need analysis and system need analysis) and solutions (logical and physical architectures), in accordance with the {IEEE} 1220 standard. In this paper, we will explain why a lot of industrial companies, such as Airbus, Airbus {DS} and Areva, are currently interested in using Capella and running modeling pilot projects with it.},

	abstract = {Traditional miniaturized fluorescence microscopes are critical tools for modern biology. Invariably, they struggle to simultaneously image with a high spatial resolution and a large field of view ({FOV}). Lensless microscopes offer a solution to this limitation. However, real-time visualization of samples is not possible with lensless imaging, as image reconstruction can take minutes to complete. This poses a challenge for usability, as real-time visualization is a crucial feature that assists users in identifying and locating the imaging target. The issue is particularly pronounced in lensless microscopes that operate at close imaging distances. Imaging at close distances requires shift-varying deconvolution to account for the variation of the point spread function ({PSF}) across the {FOV}. Here, we present a lensless microscope that achieves real-time image reconstruction by eliminating the use of an iterative reconstruction algorithm. The neural network-based reconstruction method we show here, achieves more than 10000 times increase in reconstruction speed compared to iterative reconstruction. The increased reconstruction speed allows us to visualize the results of our lensless microscope at more than 25 frames per second (fps), while achieving better than 7 \&\#x00B5;m resolution over a {FOV} of 10 mm2. This ability to reconstruct and visualize samples in real-time empowers a more user-friendly interaction with lensless microscopes. The users are able to use these microscopes much like they currently do with conventional microscopes.},

From a single 2D encoded measurement, we show the reconstruction of high-resolution 2D images, computational refocusing, and 3D imaging. This ability is made possible by our proposed high-performance contour-based {PSF}. The heuristic contour-based {PSF} is designed using concepts in signal processing to achieve maximal information transfer to a bit-depth limited sensor. Due to the efficient coding, we can use fast linear methods for high-quality image reconstructions and switch to iterative nonlinear methods for higher fidelity reconstructions and 3D imaging.},

	abstract = {This thesis presents a wireless communication system for intra-satellite communication based on Bluetooth Low Energy technology, which can have many benefits regarding the design and operation of satellites. The proposed design based on the {nRF}53832 chip from Nordic Semiconductor is described, followed by the results of several tests regarding the most important design criteria for its application in small satellites. The tested aspects include the power consumption of the wireless module in different operation modes, which is sufficiently low for the application even in small satellites. Signal strength measurements for various output power settings and obstacles show that reliable communication is possible in a satellite mockup. No packet error was detected, and latencies of less than 30 ms combined with achievable data rates between 200 and 700 kbps should be sufficient for most {CubeSat} satellites. Additionally, details are given to successfully integrate the chip with existing satellite subsystems. A code library is provided to simplify the communication between the modules, and a concept of a redundant system is established to increase the reliability for critical satellite subsystems. The overall assessment of the technology suggests that the presented system is suitable for in-orbit deployment with the Aalto-3 satellite (currently being developed at Aalto University), which will provide further validation of the technology.},

This paper investigates how such a project complexity narrative is reflected when informants talk about the role of {PM} and {SE} in two academic organizations. Most informants address uncertainty and social-political risks as part of their work, but any consistent use of a project complexity narrative is related to environmental and technical systems. The findings also indicate difficulty differentiating between the concepts of complicated and complex.

	abstract = {In this article, we describe how digital collaboration tools used during lockdown require new approaches to project management and systems engineering based on the action research case study of a {CubeSat} student team in Norway. The {COVID}-19 outbreak affected the whole world during the spring of 2020. Governments reacted by locking down countries and telling people to stay at home, and the university asked the students to work from home. Little previous research was found on managing virtual student teams, especially when not as initially planned. In this situation, many management tasks proved to require more effort than usual, such as managing team members, helping maintain work/home-balance for team members with families or focusing when working from home, and ensuring motivation and on-time project deliveries. The lock-down resulted in an increase of {GitHub} traffic on the software product. Reasons for this include (a) needing to commit software before the {CDR}, (b) strengthening of feeling that Github is a platform to work together in when the offices were closed, or (c) maturity of design in general increased contributions to code. All hardware integration efforts were put on hold, but team members expressed that they had time to focus on documentation. In a non-lockdown situation, they would not have done this because of prioritizing “hands-on” work. This may be beneficial in the long run, especially for onboarding new members to the team. Management of a team during lockdown includes evaluating and improving the technical infrastructure necessary for digital collaboration, managing the diversity of situations and other soft issues of a team, and managing schedule impacts both in the short-term and long-term. We found that project managers must make explicit efforts to maintain the project culture and motivation. For example, make efforts to replace the informal interfaces that take place in a co-located team with questions and round-the-table off-topic discussions in stand-ups and meetings. Furthermore, when large changes such as a pandemic happen, it is important to adapt and reinforce the team culture and norms. We also found that having an agile culture made the team more responsive to the change in working norms, such that there was a high willingness to “try out” the best way to lockdown-work.},

The Agile Decision Guidance method was applied to pinpoint parts of the project organization that could benefit from agile methods in three specific areas: customer problem space, solution space, and product development space. The results drew attention to areas such as; stakeholder management, knowledge and information management, and the support environment, that could benefit from an agile approach. We outline some of the plans to move forward and how the team responded to the analysis. We also discuss if the method was appropriate for academic small satellite organizations and adaptations of the method made during the assessment.},

Formal analysis of agile systems engineering helps improve success throughout the {CubeSat} lifecycle. We apply the {INCOSE} Agile systems engineering {WG} decision guidance method for applying agile system engineering method to identify areas in which the project organization can improve to become more agile in three specific problem spaces: customer problem space, solution space, and product development space. The analysis process led to valuable insights about how the project organization of an academic project differs from that of industry.

	abstract = {The global {COVID}-19 pandemic has undoubtedly forced the global community to embrace the transition to a world where remote and hybrid work models are becoming the new standard. But for the space engineering community, this change is more impactful than other engineering fields. Switching the entire workload from in-person concurrent design and verification activities to a hybrid or an online model has dominated the discussions in relevant symposia since the start of the pandemic. This switch is also more challenging when you must accommodate more than 50 developers who are volunteer students.},

	abstract = {Moore’s law states that the performance of computers doubles about every two years. This has dramatic consequences for any modern high development and for satellites. The long development cycles cause these expensive assets to be obsolete before the start of their operations. The advancement also presents challenges to their design, particularly from a thermal perspective, as more heat is dissipated and circuits are more fragile. These challenges mandate that faster spacecraft development methods are found and thermal management technologies are developed. We elaborate on existing development methodologies and present our own lean method. We explore the development of a thermal anomaly-detection payload, extending from conception to in-orbit commissioning, to stimulate discussions on space hardware development approaches. The payload consists of four miniaturized infrared cameras, heating sources in view of the cameras simulating an anomaly, an on-board processor, and peripherals for electrical and communication interfaces. The paper outlines our methodology and its application, showcasing the success of our efforts with the first-light activation of our cameras in orbit. We show our lean method, featuring reference technical and management models, from which we derive further development tools; such details are normally not available in the scientific-engineering literature. Additionally, we address the shortcomings identified during our development, such as the failure of an on-board component and propose improvements for future developments.},

	abstract = {The servitization of space is introducing profound change, challenging established companies with new business models, and significantly lowering the entry barrier to space. New types of services such as Mission-as-a-Service, Satellite-as-a-Service, Constellation-as-a-Service, etc., are introduced. However, what these notions mean is not clear and in practice, they are often used with contradicting meanings. This paper aims to provide an initial survey of various new service concepts in the space domain and develops a taxonomy and framework for classifying these emerging services with their underlying systems. A particular emphasis is put on distinguishing novel, "New Space" services from traditional space services. We find that these new space services differ, compared to traditional space services in at least three aspects: New space services have their origin in a transition from a product-to a use-oriented business model and make reference to Cloud computing and its underlying techniques such as virtualization. We conclude that analogous to the terrestrial impact of Cloud computing on the emergence of numerous e-commerce start-ups, we might see a similar surge of in-space applications, building on a new space service backbone. Such a development is likely going to be enabled by the shift from traditionally high capital expenditures of developing space applications to operating expenses, thereby lowering the entry barrier.},

The results of the bibliometric study revealed the interrelationship and distribution of researchers in multidomain fields. The authorized sources of {MBSE} papers were also assorted. The current practices of {MBSE} were analyzed. The future directions for {MBSE} based on the current practices were discussed. We found that {MBSE}’s research has been conducted by many research teams with distinctive characteristics, and the top publishing sources in this field have emerged. Research on {MBSE} focuses on system engineering, languages, system of systems, and digitalization. The development of new technologies such as next-generation modeling languages is improving current practical problems.

This is challenging, given the specifics of automotive systems that are often safety-critical and consist of software, hardware, and mechanical components. In this article, we investigate the concrete reasons for scaling agility beyond teams, the strategies that support such scaling, and the foreseeable implications that such a drastic organizational change will entail. The investigation is based on a qualitative case study, with data from 20 semistructured interviews with managers and technical experts at two automotive companies. At the core of our findings are observations about establishing an agile vehicle-level feedback loop beyond individual teams. First, we find that automotive original equipment manufacturers aim to decrease the lead time of development. Second, we also identify seven strategies that aim to enable scaled-agile beyond teams. Finally, we extract six foreseeable implications and side effects of scaling agile beyond teams in automotive. By charting the landscape of expected benefits, strategies, and implications of scaling agile beyond teams in automotive, we enable further research and process improvements.},

We analyzed U.S. patents related to {LEO} satellite technology from 1980 to 2022 using main path analysis ({MPA}) to uncover the evolutionary trajectory and the associated actors. {MPA} results reveal technological trajectories and key players in different development phases. The last phase shows that Iridium {NEXT} brings more opportunities for satellite communication. Our analysis infers four trends. First, the first Iridium satellite program facilitated the maturity of {LEO} satellite communications. Second, advanced applications are transcending geographical barriers. Third, company mergers and acquisitions help the industry grow and represent an attempt to integrate {LEO} satellite communications into services or products. Fourth, “technology implementers” will play a larger role at the forefront in the next stage of {LEO} satellite development, driving the subsequent phase of {LEO} satellite evolution.

	shorttitle = {How Artificial Intelligence Drives Sustainable Frugal Innovation},
	abstract = {Recent globalization and industrialization efforts have pushed many companies to seriously consider innovation efficiency and its effectiveness. Industries seek to integrate innovation thinking in the company, resulting in different innovation theories. However, these theories become mostly ineffective when disruptions such as pandemics, political instability, or other natural events occur. In response to such disruptions, frugal innovation has been adopted in recent years because it can maximize efficiency with fewer resources. While frugal thinking is effective from an economic perspective, not enough attention has been devoted to exploring this innovative thinking method from the perspective of other pillars of sustainability (environment and society). This article focuses on this gap to deepen the understanding of sustainable frugal innovation in a recent business environment under various theoretical perspectives (triple bottom line, diffusion of innovation, and critical success factor theories). Technology is a vehicle for innovation, so this article integrates the technological advantages of {AI} with sustainable frugal innovation as a driving force for its effective implementation; other existing studies are limited. Integrating {AI} with sustainable frugal innovation requires precise actions that can be the result of understanding {AIs} critical success factors from the perspectives of sustainable frugal thinking. Therefore, this article analyzes the critical success factors for {AI} through grey {DEMA}℡. A research framework has been proposed and validated with a Danish case study context. Among 24 overall common critical success factors, “understanding the concept of {AI}” and “level of {AI} investment” in sustainable frugal innovation are identified as the most influential success factors. In addition, influential connections among other overall common success factors are presented. These findings could motivate industries to explore different options for successfully integrating {AI} with their sustainable frugal thinking, which may increase their business competitiveness during disruptions in a more sustainable way.},

	title = {Fundamentals of Agile Systems Engineering – Part 1 and Part 2},
	volume = {24},
	abstract = {Agile systems-engineering and agile-systems engineering are two different concepts that share the word agile. In the first case the system of interest is an engineering process, and in the second case the system of interest is what is produced by an engineering process. The word agile refers to the adaptability and the sustainment of adaptability in both types of systems. Sustained adaptability is enabled by an architectural pattern and a set of system design principles that are fundamental and common to both types of systems. Research that identified this architectural pattern and design principles is reported, updated, and applied here in two Parts. Part 1 focuses on agile-systems engineering, reviewing the origins, values, and core concepts that define and enable domain independent agility in any type of system. Part 2 focuses on agile systems-engineering, identifying core agility-enabling concepts in the software-development domain-specific practice known as Scrum, reviewing an agile hardware/software satellite-development systems-engineering case for its source of agility, and then suggesting the development of an agile systems-engineering life cycle model as a natural next step. Introduction The value proposition of an agile system is rooted in risk management, providing options when system mission or system survival is threatened. Some might say the purpose or objective of an agile system is risk management, but natural agile systems exist without that purpose/objective, just that benefit. Most natural systems have evolved sufficient agility to sustain existence in the inherently risky environments that surround them. But nature doesn't care. Agility is a byproduct of natural selection, an algorithm without an objective (Dennett 1995), based on replication with variation in a competitive environment; an algorithm that unwittingly experiments with expendable resources over long periods of time. This method is generally not suitable to systems designed and built by man for purposeful objective, if these systems are to remain effective in an uncertain and unpredictable environment for a reasonable period of time. But we can learn from nature's experiments, perhaps improve upon their results, for nature finds sufficient but not necessarily optimal solutions.},

	abstract = {Secondary spacecraft are being put in orbit at the rate of hundreds per year, with each year smashing the record set by the previous. These “piggyback” missions (which reach orbit using the unused mass/volume in a launch vehicle) come from every source: universities, government labs, large contractors, startups and even art collectives (⁈⁈). There are Beepsats, journal-worthy science missions, operational sigint missions, radio Amateur missions, technology demonstrations and venture-capital-backed remote sensing missions. For today, secondary spacecraft are almost exclusively low-Earth-orbiting missions, though even that limitation is changing. Despite the breadth of mission sponsors, mission developers, mission types and orbital domains, our terminology is unchanged and contradictory: cubesat (or {CubeSat}), picosat, smallsat. More importantly, decisionmakers hear a phrase like “half of all {CubeSats} fail” and assume that there's something inherently flawed in the {CubeSat} concept - instead of recognizing that half of “all” {CubeSats} fail because hobbyists make up more than half of all {CubeSats}, and their ad hoc practices fail two-thirds of the time. In this paper, we propose two taxonomies for secondary spacecraft: the first, based on the type of mission developer (e.g., Hobbyist, Crafter, Industrialist) and the second based on the type of mission flown (e.g., constellation, experiment, short operational, long operational and extreme operational). We will contrast these taxonomies against the existing ones (such as {NASA}'s Class A/B/C/etc). Finally, we will use these new taxonomies to parse our existing secondary spacecraft database to provide meaningful examinations of mission types, mission success rates and opportunities for further study.},

	title = {Heritage Technologies in Space Programs - Assessment Methodology and Statistical Analysis},
	url = {https://mediatum.ub.tum.de/node?id=1308879&change_language=en},
	abstract = {An established approach to cost and risk reduction in system development programs is the use of heritage technologies. A heritage technology is defined as a proven technology, reused in a new use context, in an unaltered or adapted form. Heritage technologies are particularly relevant for space systems development programs, as their development costs are usually high and stakeholders risk-averse. Nevertheless, numerous space programs encountered problems linked to improper ‘management’ of heritage technologies when reused, i.e., improper use, implementation or adaptation. Improperly managed heritage technologies can lead to cost and schedule overruns, or even failure in the reuse application. Currently, the applicability of heritage technologies is mostly assessed ad-hoc. The existing assessment approaches are deemed to be insufficient for providing decision-makers and analysts with ample guidance on the applicability of heritage technologies. 
This thesis presents a methodology for assessing heritage technologies in the early phases of development, taking the new use context of the technology, its necessary adaptations and modifications, as well as technological capabilities of the implementing organization into consideration. For illuminating the relationship between the use of heritage technologies and the performance of space programs empirically, a statistical analysis is performed.
The methodology focuses on the early phases, where most of the technology selection takes place. A 3-component framework is developed that serves as the theoretical basis for the statistical analysis and the methodology. The framework consists of a systems architecting framework, a technology framework, and a verification, validation, testing, and operation framework. 
Based on the concepts developed in the framework, a statistical analysis is performed. Using multiple regression with control variables, a statistically significant relationship between heritage technology and specific development cost / development duration was confirmed. No statistically significant relationship between heritage use and development cost overrun / schedule overrun could be identified.
Based on the framework and results from the statistical analysis, a methodology for assessing heritage technologies in the early phases is developed. It allows for identifying potential compliance issues of the heritage technology with respect to changed needs and requirements. Estimating the impact of modifications is performed via design structure matrices and a graph-edit-similarity algorithm. Furthermore, a heritage metric is presented that can be used for measuring heritage with respect to a new application. Finally, the methodology also allows for assessing technological and organizational capabilities. 
The methodology is validated by three space system case studies: 1) a {CubeSat} component technology, 2) a high-pressure tank technology for the Ariane 5 launcher, and 3) the Saturn V and Space Launch System technology. 
From the presented work it can be concluded that the methodology can be systematically applied to various types of space systems at different levels of decomposition. The heritage metric provides a rough estimate of heritage of a technology for a new application and context. The statistical analysis confirmed that in general using heritage technologies significantly reduces specific development cost and development duration. As future work, the developed methodology could be extended to other domains such as automotive engineering, aeronautics, and medical engineering, where heritage also plays an important role.},

	shorttitle = {Agile Development and the Constraints of Physicality},
	abstract = {Not only software development, but also many companies developing physical products (not purely software) face high uncertainties and dynamics which raises the need for agile practices well-proven in software development. However, so-called constraints of physicality (e.g. duration to build potentially shippable increments) make it very difficult to become agile. Challenges associated with the constraints of physicality are highly interdependent and form an entangled, complex system. It is not obvious to find the root or pinpoint challenges with extraordinary high influence on others. Therefore, the investigation's goal is to identify most important challenges by separating between causes and effects. Knowing this can increase the effectiveness of research efforts in the realm of agile development. The investigation identifies 153 challenges and 160 interdependencies, and detects four backbones through the network that experts from industry rate highly influencing. Those point in particular to issues with product separation into increments, flexibility and scaling that represent very effective directions to overcome or reduce the impact of the constraints of physicality.},

However, no systematic survey of the potential advantages and unique mission concepts based on {AttoSats} exists. This paper explores the potential of {AttoSats} for future space missions. First, we present the state of the art of {AttoSats}. Next, we identify unique {AttoSat} characteristics and map them to future mission capabilities. Finally, we go beyond {AttoSats} and explore how smart dust and nano-scale spacecraft could allow for even smaller spacecraft in the milligram range: zepto- and yocto spacecraft.},

I hope to have an easy to use {GUI} application for Windows, Mac, and Linux by our launch date, along with a website for uploading radio recordings. I'll be posting a lot more information on how to set up ground stations in the coming weeks, including a how-to guide and videos.Thank you once again to everyone who has made this huge milestone possible!Happy Holidays,Zac},

The implemented tools were co-designed and validated iteratively in the concrete industrial context of Critical Software ({CSW}) projects, within a wider research work towards continuous certification [3]. We interviewed Critical Software professionals to validate our solution, collected feedback on the implemented tools and got insights for future work. The tools were also the target of synthetic tests that allowed us to conclude that document automation is possible in the critical-safety software development industry and carries several benefits. The developed tools are not yet qualified in compliance with the {DO}-330 standard (Tools Qualification).},

	abstract = {{PocketQubes} are a form factor of highly miniaturized satellites with a body of one or more cubic units of 5 cm. In this paper, the characteristics of {PocketQubes} in terms of their constraints and their (potential) utility are treated. To avoid space debris and limit collision risk, the orbits of {PocketQubes} need to be constraint. An analysis of orbital decay characteristics has been carried out which, considering existing space regulations and a pro-active attitude, {PocketQubes} should preferably be launched in low Earth orbits below 400 km altitude. Due to technical constraints, such as form factor, power and attitude control, the domain of applications for single {PocketQube} missions is limited. Still, they can act as low-cost training and technology demonstration platforms. To make {PocketQubes} an attractive platform for other types of missions, not only the launch cost, but also the development, production and operations cost should be significantly lower than {CubeSats}. When the {PocketQube} platform matures and produced in high numbers, networks of {PocketQubes} can enable new applications. Applications considered feasible are in the field of (but not limited to) continuous surveillance using optical instruments, gravity field monitoring using precise orbit determination, in-situ measurements of the space environment, low data rate or bandwidth communication services and inexpensive probes around other celestial bodies.},

	shorttitle = {Agile development of physical products},
	abstract = {Die vorliegende Querschnittstudie erfasst den Stand der Anwendung und Umsetzung der agilen Produktentwicklung
physischer Produkte im deutschsprachigen Raum. Ziel der Studie ist es, interessierten Personen und Organisationen
einen Bezugsrahmen im Vergleich zu einer mittels Praxis und Erfahrung gebildeten Referenzbasis außerhalb
der Softwareindustrie anzubieten. Dies ermöglicht, Projektplanungen oder laufende Transformationen zu prüfen,
Vorgehensweisen und Entscheidungen abzusichern und Einzelerfahrungen einzuordnen.
Wie in den Jahren 2018 und 2019 sind sowohl wissenschaftliche Erkenntnisse als auch praktische Umsetzungserfahrungen
der Studienpartner in das Design der Studie eingeflossen. Als Online-Befragung ausgeführt, konnte eine
Stichprobe mit 125 Teilnehmern aus circa 80 Unternehmen der fertigenden Industrie realisiert werden (⇨ Demografie).
Mit 36 Detailfragen in den vier Themenfeldern ⇨ Verständnis, ⇨ Anwendung, ⇨ Herausforderungen \&
Lösungsansätze sowie ⇨ Skalierung wurden die Informationen erhoben. Somit liegt auch 2020 ein relevanter, neutraler
und facettenreicher Einblick in die industrielle Praxis der agilen Produktentwicklung physischer Produkte vor.
Aus Sicht des Autorenteams sind folgende komprimierten Ergebnisse und Tendenzen erkennbar:
• Agile Produktentwicklung ist weiter attraktiv und wächst. Gewohnte („klassische“) Projektarbeit geht zurück.
Zeiträume von drei bis fünf Jahren sind für erfolgreiche Umsetzungen einzuplanen und unterscheiden Anfänger
von Fortgeschrittenen.
• In der Mehrheit wird Agile Produktentwicklung mit flexibel, transparent und kundenorientiert assoziiert. Für
zwei Drittel der Teilnehmer erleichtert agiles Arbeiten den Alltag. Methodisch dominieren Scrum, Kanban und
Design Thinking.
• Die Wirkung agiler Produktentwicklung wird mehrheitlich über die Verbesserungen erfolgsfördernder Faktoren
der Kooperation und Transparenz wahrgenommen. Harte, messbare Erfolgskennwerte werden aktuell nur
von einer Minderheit bejaht.
• Wechselwirkungen zur physischen Natur der Produkte werden klar als Schwierigkeiten benannt. Mehrheitlich
werden externe Regularien, Wartezeiten für Bauteile und Zulieferabhängigkeiten als Faktoren bejaht.
Produktseitig wird Modularisierung und Schnittstellenstandardisierung als wichtige Verbesserungsoptionen
rückgemeldet.
• In der Mehrheit wird Agile Produktentwicklung durch {IT}-Tools und additive Fertigungsverfahren gestützt. Einfache
Office-Tools dominieren in der Zustimmung. Rapid Prototyping ist in der physischen Welt bereits Standard
und nicht mehr stark differenzierend.
• Agile Produktentwicklung ist nach wie vor kein fertiges Konzept. Hybridisierungen zwischen bewährten Hausstandards
und agilen Elementen sind stark zunehmend. 70 \% der Studienteilnehmer passen Elemente, Methoden
oder Leitbilder in bedeutendem Umfang an. Vorlagen und Frameworks werden zur Orientierung genutzt.
Kopieren aus Vorlagen erscheint nicht zielführend zu sein.
• In der Umsetzung Agiler Produktentwicklung liegen nach wie vor Herausforderungen. Zentrales Hemmnis
bleibt das Verständnis von Agilität. Wissenstransfer und Ausbildung sind dominierende Lösungsfaktoren. Ungelöste
Führungsfragen wie Machtverlust oder Karrierepfade sind bedeutende Konfliktpotenziale. Selbstorganisation
und Empowerment der Teams ist gering.
• Agile Produktentwicklung verlässt das Einzelprojekt und wird zunehmend skaliert. Skalierung ist heterogen
belegt und erfasst das Projektportfolio, die Organisation oder die Führung. Skalierungs-Frameworks werden
umfangreich adaptiert (sogenannte Hybride). Koordination und Kommunikation zwischen agilen Teams sind
die dominant genannten Herausforderungen.
Insgesamt zeigt die Studie, dass das Konzept „Agile Produktentwicklung“ in der physikalischen Welt der Produkte
weiter vorankommt, eigene Wege und Prägungen ausbildet und gegenüber der Software-Welt aufholt. Ein Abklingen
der Veränderungsbemühungen ist nicht erkennbar.},

Introduction to Space Systems concentrates on understanding the interaction between all the forces, both technical and non-technical, which influence the definition of a space system. This book refers to the entire system: space and ground segments, mission objectives as well as to cost, risk, and mission success probabilities. Introduction to Space Systems is divided into two parts. The first part analyzes the process of space system design in an abstract way. The second part of the book focuses on concrete aspects of the space system design process. It concentrates on interactions between design decisions and uses past design examples to illustrate these interactions. The idea is for the reader to acquire a good insight in what is a good design by analyzing these past designs.},

	abstract = {Lean satellite programs are programs in which the satellite development philosophy is driven by fast delivery and low cost. Though this concept offers the possibility to develop and fly risky missions without jeopardizing a space program, most of these satellites suffer infant mortality and fail to achieve their mission minimum success. Lean satellites with high infant mortality rate indicate that testing prior to launch is insufficient. In this study, the authors monitored failures occurring during the development of the lean satellite {HORYU}-{IV} to identify the evolution of the cumulative number of failures against cumulative testing time. Moreover, the sub-systems driving the failures depending on the different development phases were identified. The results showed that half to 2/3 of the failures are discovered during the early stage of testing. Moreover, when the mean time before failure was calculated, it appeared that for any development phase considered, a new failure appears on average every 20h of testing. Simulations were also performed and it showed that for an initial testing time of 50h, reliability after 1 month launch can be improved by nearly 6 times as compared to an initial testing time of 20h. Through this work, the authors aim at providing a qualitative reference for lean satellites developers to better help them manage resources to develop lean satellites following a fast delivery and low cost philosophy while ensuring sufficient reliability to achieve mission minimum success.},

Frustrated by waiting weeks to receive test results, or delivering code only to find the hardware it will run isn't ready yet? Do you feel like your hardware partners just don't understand what you're doing?

This paper explores applying agile ideas to a field which isn't entirely agile. We'll show how to use the 'integration by slice' method to bring together and test the results of hardware and software development incrementally, planning in a fashion that serves the differing demands of both disciplines.

In this presentation, you will learn:

    why hardware and software integration plans often conflict with each other

    how to better coordinate firmware development, software app development, hardware development, and system testing by using slices through your system

    how to plan slices which deliver feedback to your development partners earlier and improve communication between all the teams

    some principles for testing emergent behavior in stages

	doi = {10.1109/TEM.2009.2033144},
	abstract = {Projects are temporary allocations of resources commissioned to achieve a desired result. Since each project is unique, the landscape between the current state (the start of the project) and the desired state (the successful end of the project) is often dynamic, uncertain, and ambiguous. Conventional project plans define a set of related activities (a work breakdown structure and activity network) with the assumptions that this set is necessary and sufficient to reach the project's desired result. Popular models for project planning (scheduling, budgeting, etc.) and control are also based on a set of project activities that are specified and scheduled a priori. However, these assumptions often do not hold, because, as an attempt to do something novel, the actual path to a project's desired result is often revealed only by the additional light provided once the work is underway. In this paper, we model a product development process as a complex adaptive system. Rather than prespecifying which activities will be done and when, we set up: 1) a superset of general classes of activities, each with modes that vary in terms of inputs, duration, cost, and expected benefits; and 2) simple rules for activity mode combination. Thus, instead of rigidly dictating a specific project schedule a priori, we provide a “primordial soup” of activities and simple rules through which the activities can self-organize. Instead of attempting to prescribe an optimal process, we simulate thousands of adaptive cases and let the highest-value process emerge. Analyzing these cases leads to insights regarding the most likely paths (processes) across the project landscape, the patterns of iteration along the paths, and the paths’ costs, durations, risks, and values. The model also provides a decision support capability for managers. For researchers, this way of viewing projects and the modeling framework provide a new basis for future studies of agile and adaptive processes.},

Objective: This study seeks to evaluate, synthesize, and present aspects of research on agile methods tailoring including the method tailoring approaches adopted and the criteria used for agile practice selection. Method: The method adopted was a Systematic Literature Review ({SLR}) on studies published from 2002 to 2014. Results: 56 out of 783 papers have been identified as describing agile method tailoring approaches. These studies have been identified as case studies regarding the empirical research, as solution proposals regarding the research type, and as evaluation studies regarding the research validation type. Most of the papers used method engineering to implement tailoring and were not specific to any agile method on their scope. Conclusion: Most of agile methods tailoring research papers proposed or improved a technique, were implemented as case studies analyzing one case in details and validated their findings using evaluation. Method engineering was the base for tailoring, the approaches are independent of agile method and the main criteria used are internal environment and objectives variables.},

Although the need to tailor a software process to specific project requirements seems to be widely accepted and unquestioned, the way of doing the tailoring remains unclear and is, therefore, often left to the expertise of process engineers or project managers. What are the criteria to be applied in the tailoring? What are dependencies between different criteria and how should certain criteria influence the software process? In this paper we investigate concrete tailoring criteria for the tailoring of software processes. To this end, we present a collection of 49 tailoring criteria as the outcomes of a systematic literature review. We further analyze the impact of the discovered tailoring criteria by relating them to a set of 20 exemplary tailoring actions, which affect the project-specific software process. Our outcomes show that the factors influencing the tailoring are well understood, however, the consequences of the criteria remain abstract and need to be interpreted on a project-per-project basis.},

In this article, theories supporting Agile and Model-Based Systems Engineering ({MBSE}) methodologies are reviewed and found to be a key enabler of Agile methods for systems engineering. A process for performing Agile systems engineering using a model-based approach for complex systems addressing steps identified in the {INCOSE} systems engineering handbook is presented.},

	abstract = {A fundamental challenge for system engineers is to capture a problem with an effective model or framework and then facilitate transferring the information of that captured problem to practical systems engineering tools and methods. The early problem definition phase requires an application of systems thinking with adequate modeling tools and methods. Then, the later problem definition phase and early system architecting phase requires transferring the captured problem to systems engineering tools and methods through emerging techniques such as model-based systems engineering ({MBSE}) using {SysML} ({MBSE} is the practice of using a modeling tools to capture systems engineering diagrams). This paper presents a method for capturing a problem through systemigrams and the Boardman soft systems methodology and then directly translating the systemigrams into {SysML} diagrams. With {MBSE} increasing in usage, this method could provide a time savings opportunity during model development along with the possibility of lowering information distortion or loss that can occur during transformation of systems thinking to systems engineering activities. This paper includes a case study which demonstrates how the proposed approach was applied on a problem being considered by the U.S. Army-Contingency Basing for Small Combat Units. Finally, this paper will provide the conclusion on the development of the method and describe future research directions that can allow systems thinking and {MBSE} to function in a congruent methodology.},

One way that this can be achieved is by performing early functional validation of the high-level spacecraft functional avionics system. The use case discussed in this article focusses on the Biomass model, a systems modeling language-based representation of the Biomass Earth-observation mission. The {MBSE} approach is used to calculate the required size of the data handling unit onboard the Biomass spacecraft. The functional response of the system in terms of the onboard memory usage throughout the mission is simulated. Traditionally, this level of analysis would not be available at this early stage. The approach aims to replace ad hoc, spreadsheet-based calculations with a formal representation of the system that can be executed, interrogated and quantified. The flexibility of this {MBSE} approach is demonstrated by applying changes to the Biomass project and assessing the time required to implement these changes in the Biomass model and propagate them through to the results of the simulation. The changes have been made independently of each other and include: changes to the logical architecture, changes to the functional definition, changes to the mission profile, and changes to the requirements. Potential areas for improvement regarding the structure of the Biomass model are highlighted and discussed.},

This article proposes {VFR} trajectory modeling based on mission type and typical flight characteristics. The idea is illustrated with a reconnaissance mission mimicking landmark (highway) tracking to check for postdisaster damages. Results from a flight campaign with an experimental helicopter conducted in 2020 verify the assumptions posed at trajectory modeling and identify the degree of uncertainties necessary to determine the buffers around each trajectory and therefore design operation volumes. The same mission-based trajectory modeling and operation volume design approach can be applied to further missions and vehicles, which makes it transferable to the needs of advanced air mobility as well, especially addressing dense operations.},

Its successor, the {PocketQube} class seems to be a lower size limit for a satellite which can operate continuously and can be received by radio amateur equipment. The present paper discusses the simulation of the thermal environment of the {SMOG}-1 {PocketQube} satellite at low Earth orbit by both thermal network and finite element models. The major findings of the analyses are the following. Even a single node per printed circuit board model can provide adequate information about the thermal behavior without tuning the physical parameters. By applying a finite element model with few magnitudes more nodes, the predicted inner temperature increased as the losses were reduced in the radiation-dominant environment compared to the thermal network model. Therefore, this latter method provides a more conservative temperature estimation. The most sensitive component of small-sized satellites is the battery which remains in the desired positive temperature regime even in this satellite class according to the finite element model. However, the thermal network model predicted a restricted battery charging protocol to ∼50\% of the lit duration. Nevertheless, this condition still results in a positive energy balance by a factor of 1.5.},

This new form factor brings its own challenges on every subsystem and it is seen as a stepping stone towards even more miniaturised satellites. In this paper we present the design trade-oﬀs, the analysis and the and measurements on the antenna system. The system is designed to operate in 4 diﬀerent bands to guarantee communications and payload operations. Due to the very limited available space on the external faces of the spacecraft, it was decided to deploy all the antennas and multiplex the diﬀerent bands on the available antenna elements. {VHF} and {UHF} are used for satellite telemetry and commanding while a dual-frequency {GPS} receiver is intended as payload. The satellite design is presented, together with design drivers for such a system to justify the design choices. Three {RF} conﬁgurations are analysed and compared for omni-directional coverage and peak gain. {RF} measurements on one of the conﬁgurations is also presented to validate the simulations. The deployment system is also presented, giving details on the design and expected tests to complete the qualiﬁcations.},

The aim of this publication is to begin filling this gap by systematically reviewing the existing literature on agile software development methodologies. This publication has three purposes. First, it proposes a definition and a classification of agile software development approaches. Second, it analyses ten software development methods that can be characterized as being "agile" against the defined criterion.

	abstract = {Firms have never known more about their customers, but their innovation processes remain hit-or-miss. Why? According to Christensen and his coauthors, product developers focus too much on building customer profiles and looking for correlations in data. To create offerings that people truly want to buy, firms instead need to home in on the job the customer is trying to get done. Some jobs are little (pass the time); some are big (find a more fulfilling career). When we buy a product, we essentially “hire” it to help us do a job. If it does the job well, we hire it again. If it does a crummy job, we “fire” it and look for something else to solve the problem. Jobs are multifaceted. They’re never simply about function; they have powerful social and emotional dimensions. And the circumstances in which customers try to do them are more critical than any buyer characteristics. Consider the experiences of condo developers targeting retirees who wanted to downsize their homes. Sales were weak until the developers realized their business was not construction but transitioning lives. Instead of adding more features to the condos, they created services assisting buyers with the move and with their decisions about what to keep and to discard. Sales took off. The key to successful innovation is identifying jobs that are poorly performed in customers’ lives and then designing products, experiences, and processes around those jobs.},

A design approach to innovation is presented as a solution to the problem. However, practice shows that teams that use design nevertheless encounter implementation challenges due to the larger infrastructure of the organization they are part of. This research aims to explore which organizational factors contribute to the Valley of Death during design innovation. An embedded multiple case study at a large heritage airline is applied. Four projects are analyzed to identify implementation challenges. A thematic data analysis reveals organizational design, departmental silos, and dissimilar innovation strategies contribute to the formation of, and encounters with, the Valley of Death. Arising resource-assignment challenges that result from these factors are also identiﬁed. Materialization, user-centeredness, and holistic problem framing are identiﬁed as design practices that mitigate encounters with the Valley of Death, thus leading to projects being fully realized.},

Here we argue that such diversity is not haphazard and that we must be cautious about developing all-embracing standards to differentiate the ‘good’ from the ‘bad’. Rather this diversity is inspired by different philosophical stances, which usually remain tacit in published accounts thereby fuelling ambiguity and controversy about what action research should entail in practice and as to its ‘scientific’ status. The aim of this article is to explain the apparent diversity of action research in the organization studies domain, by clarifying how variable philosophical assumptions systematically lead to the constitution of distinctive forms of action research with their attendant conceptions of social science. This diversity is illustrated, with examples from the relevant literature, in terms of variation in: the aims of action research; its conception of social science; the role of the action researcher and their relations with members; the validity criteria deployed and the internal tensions that arise.},

During an eighteen-month action research project, we implemented the design-led innovation framework inside an Australian Airport Corporation. Our research revealed that three narrative techniques—low-fidelity narratives, realistic narratives, and strategy narratives—particularly supported several key stages of this creative innovation process. Narratives enabled us to surface internally-held assumptions and beliefs and test their validity with external customers and stakeholders; they established common ground among various stakeholders during the innovation process; they served to convince managers to pursue design-led innovation outputs; and they facilitated the co-creation and implementation of a company-wide strategy.

Remote sensing application is the main sector in which {CubeSats} are being used, corresponding to about 45\% of all applications. This fact indicates the commercial potential of such a platform. Fifty eight countries have already been involved with developing {CubeSats}. The most used {CubeSat} configuration is 3U (about 64\%), followed by 1U (18\%), while 6U platforms account for about 4\%. In this paper, we present an analysis of the current situation regarding {CubeSats} worldwide, through the use of a dataset built to encompass information about these satellites. The overall success rate of the {CubeSat} missions is increasing over time. Moreover, considering {CubeSat} missions as a Bernoulli experiment, and excluding launch failures, the current success rate was estimated, as a parameter of a binomial distribution, to be about 75\%. By using a logistic model and considering that the launchings keep following the current tendency, one can expect that one thousand {CubeSats} will be launched in 2021, within 95\% certainty.},

            Knowledge professionals are often responsible for document automation projects in law firms and in-house legal departments. This article by Robert Lankester is written to provide insight for a wide range of knowledge professionals (in fact anyone curious about document automation), from those for whom it is a new concept to the experienced document automation specialist. First is a discussion of what document automation is (and is not), and the benefits for knowledge management ({KM}). The main focus of the article is guidance on project implementation, with a specific focus on resourcing. Specific tips for preparing a document for automation and alternative project ideas are included. The article concludes that document automation is a powerful tool for internal knowledge development, enabling deeper collaboration with clients and changing the way legal services are delivered. Resourcing document automation can be approached in a number of ways but whatever the approach, the key is to ensure that business engagement is appropriately catered for.},

The implemented tools were co-designed and validated iteratively in the concrete industrial context of Critical Software ({CSW}) projects, within a wider research work towards continuous certification [3]. We interviewed Critical Software professionals to validate our solution, collected feedback on the implemented tools and got insights for future work. The tools were also the target of synthetic tests that allowed us to conclude that document automation is possible in the critical-safety software development industry and carries several benefits.

This paper puts the concept of method in the context of related concepts and proposes a multi-level model of the elements of a method to argue that a contribution on each of these levels can be of value and that the introduction of methods can fail on each of these levels. Implications thereof for industry and academia are discussed, concluding that a clear description of methods and their intended use is important for enabling proper validation of each of the method’s elements and for communicating methods to academia and industry.},

Achieving this task on small satellites, and nanosatellites in particular, is further challenging, because the limited power and computational resources available on-board, together with the low development budget, set strict constraints on the selection of the sensors and the complexity of the algorithms. Attitude determination is obtained here from the only measurements of a three-axis magnetometer and a model of the Geomagnetic field, stored on the on-board computer. First, the angular rates are estimated and processed using a second-order low-pass Butterworth filter, then they are used as an input, along with Geomagnetic field data, to estimate the attitude matrix using an unsymmetrical {TRIAD}. The computational efficiency is enhanced by arranging complex matrix operations into a form of the Faddeev algorithm, which is implemented using systolic array architecture on the {FPGA} core of a {CubeSat} on-board computer. The performance and the robustness of the algorithm are evaluated by means of numerical analyses in {MATLAB} Simulink, showing pointing and angular rate accuracy below 10° and 0.2°/s. The algorithm implemented on {FPGA} is verified by Hardware-in-the-loop simulation, confirming the results from numerical analyses and efficiency.},

	abstract = {Model-based Systems Engineering ({MBSE}) is a turning point for companies in the manufacturing and engineering sectors that in recent years have increasingly understood the need to digitize themselves, satisfy the growing demand to produce new technologies, supply quality products and services in a short time with low costs. Its use could also bring benefits to the development of {CubeSat} missions, which until now has been done through document-based approaches. This thesis aims to improve and enrich the first phases of the {SROC} (Space Rider Observer Cube) space mission project, a small satellite capable of rendezvous and docking, through the construction of models to describe its different areas and realize through reverse engineering an {MBSE} procedure for similar missions. To achieve this goal, an overview of the {MBSE} state of the art was initially outlined, researching the main methodologies, languages and tools, to understand what potential advantages or challenges could derive from this approach, focusing on the functionality of the software Capella, a tool that implements the Arcadia (Architecture Analysis and Design Integrated Approach) methodology and Valispace. These were selected after a simple trade-off study based on bibliography and practical experience and were used for the {SROC} mission. Capella was used to create models related to stakeholders and needs analysis, functional analysis, the construction of logical and physical architecture, Valispace, for the collection and management of requirements, to define the mission architecture, implementing the characteristics physical components, and to obtain, also thanks to the use of add-ons, mass, volume, power, energy and link budget. Finally, through a process of abstraction, a procedure was provided, usable as a guide, to carry out, in the best possible way, future model-based missions projects for small satellites.  The systems engineer, following this guide, will be able to develop, in a simple, quick and intuitive way, by making the appropriate modifications, the initial phases of his interest space project.},

	abstract = {The Delfi program run at Delft University of Technology has the objective to provide a means of fast and affordable pre-qualification of new (micro-)technology in space. A second objective is to offer to {MSc} students the possibility to graduate on real hardware and software development for space missions. The first satellite in this program is Delfi-C3, a 3 kg {CubeSat}, which flies a new type of Thin Film Solar Cells, two Autonomous Wireless Sun Sensors and a miniaturized {UHF}-{VHF} transponder. Next in the series will be a Delfi-C3 successor, on which a more efficient power subsystem and a high efficiency Advanced Transceiver will be flown. Further missions are considered which will fly micro-technology now under development in the {MISAT} research program. The paper describes the Delfi-C3 mission and satellite with its payload. Emphasis is given to technical solutions and the way the project is implemented in the university’s educational program. An overview is given of the current status of the project and plans for the future development of Delfi missions are outlined.},

It carries three experimental payloads: Aalto Spectral Imager({AaSI}), Radiation Monitor ({RADMON}) and Electrostatic Plasma Brake ({EPB}). {AaSI} is a hyperspectral imager in visible and near-infrared ({NIR}) wavelength bands, {RADMON} is an energetic particle detector and {EPB} is a de-orbiting technology demonstration payload. The platform was designed to accommodate multiple payloads while ensuring sufficient data, power, radio, mechanical and electrical interfaces. The design strategy of platform and payload subsystems consists of in-house development and commercial subsystems. The {CubeSat} Assembly, Integration \& Test ({AIT}) followed Flatsat-Engineering-Qualication Model ({EQM})-Flight Model ({FM}) model philosophy for qualification and acceptance. The paper briefly describes the design approach of platform and payload subsystems, their integration and test campaigns and spacecraft launch.

	title = {Integrating Agile Systems Engineering and Project Management in Small Satellites Development},
	url = {https://ntnuopen.ntnu.no/ntnu-xmlui/handle/11250/3005361},
	abstract = {This dissertation aims to improve our understanding of applied research projects in academia, in particular, how the integration of Systems Engineering ({SE}) and Project Management ({PM}) activities can support these projects. This is studied in the context of a university {CubeSat} organization called {HYPSO}, which aims at contributing scientific data and operational capabilities in a network of autonomous systems to improve our monitoring and understanding of the oceans. This network is a part of the Mission-oriented Autonomous Systems with Small Satellites for Maritime Sensing, Surveillance and Communication ({MASSIVE}) project. The overarching goal of the project organization is to reduce the time between the mission concept is defined and launch while still ensuring project success, through changing and adapting their development methodology and processes.  The project is highly interdisciplinary and produces complex engineered systems. {SE} and {PM} offer heuristics for addressing complexity, but require resources and competencies not found in many academic research projects. Little empirical research was found on how universities conduct applied research projects, and to what degree {SE} and {PM} practices are applied. The research aim and goal gave the following research questions: 
{RQ}-0: What are known sociotechnical challenges in university {CubeSat} projects and how can they be addressed? 
{RQ}-1: What factors influence the development time of university {CubeSat} systems?   
{RQ}-2: To what extent do agile processes support known university {CubeSat} project challenges linked to knowledge management, system testing, project management, and team composition?   
{RQ}-3: To what extent can Model-Based Systems Engineering support university {CubeSat} projects and the development of System-of-Systems? 
These are addressed based on the findings from (i) a longitudinal replication case study of a university {CubeSat} team consisting of long-term {PhD}-level researchers and students that join the project for the duration of a schoolyear; and (ii) 18 semi-structured interviews. Participatory Action Research and interviews are the primary methods for collecting the data. The analysis is supported by system modeling methods and tools such as Model-Based Systems Engineering ({MBSE}), Systemigrams, Agile Decision-Guidance, Readiness Levels, and N2-diagrams. The research questions are addressed through the ten publications included in this thesis.   
{RQ}-0 is addressed in the literature review, and supported by findings from the case study. The literature review highlights sociotechnical challenges encountered when conducting {CubeSat} projects at universities: project management, team and organization, balancing schoolwork with project work, ensuring mission success, knowledge management, and stakeholder management.   
{RQ}-1 goes deeper into the case study, developing an understanding of what factors affect the development time of space systems in university {CubeSat} projects. A combination of analysis methods highlights the following factors: external facilities and support environment, communication and information flow, goal alignment and clear objectives, work planning and knowledge management. 
In {RQ}-2, this dissertation looks at how agile {SE} and {PM} practices meet these challenges, by using the {HYPSO} project as a replication case study. Agile values (often operationalized by Scrum or {eXtreme} Programming frameworks) promote “Individuals and interactions over processes and tools”, “Working software over comprehensive documentation”, “Customer collaboration over contract negotiation”, and “Responding to change over following a plan” [1].   
Findings from the case study show that the project exhibits many characteristics suitable for an agile approach, as opposed to a directed plan approach. A tailored Scrum approach enables improved planning, communication, alignment of goals, and responsiveness to stakeholders, changing working situations, external facilities and the support environment. In addition, the project was well supported by digital tools and workflows, contributing to moving the organization towards adopting Digital Engineering. 
{RQ}-3 investigates to what extent {MBSE} practices can support university {CubeSat} projects and address some of the challenges identified in {RQ}-0 and {RQ}-1. {MBSE} is hailed as a paradigm shift in {SE}, improving the workflow by enabling system designers and stakeholders to describe the complex system-of-interest from different viewpoints, without losing the semantic relationship between the operational, logical, physical, and system viewpoints. 
Findings from the application of {MBSE} in the case study show possible improvements in traceability of dependability analysis and system design, when compared to document-based {SE}. There is also potential to reuse dependability and system design for future satellites, which could lower the resource needs moving forward. The findings reported in this thesis indicate that taking a Systems-of-Systems ({SoS}) approach to viewing the {MASSIVE} project supported the design process of the different Constituent Systems ({CS}) and identified missing functionality and interfaces by establishing an overall {SoS} architecture and concept of operations.   
This research contributes to both theory and practice by showing how an integrated approach to agile Systems Engineering and Project Management supported by Digital Engineering tools and methods can improve the way applied research projects are managed at universities, specifically when developing systems for space. In addition, the research contributes with experiential evidence of the value of using an {SoS} viewpoint to coordinate the development efforts and integration of multiple assets. This dissertation supports the efforts of adopting {MBSE}, and further towards Digital Engineering.},

It explored the reasons, why companies in the space industry that are in the process of moving from a document-based systems engineering approach to Model Based Systems Engineering ({MBSE}), don’t yet widely adopt existing {MBSE} solutions, due to their complexity and inflexibility. The proposed solution to the lack of adoption presented a browser-based, collaborative engineering tool which ensures consistent data throughout the whole project lifecycle. This paper expands on that assumption and presents the concept of a new data-driven systems engineering approach to spread the use of {MBSE} in the industry.},

The approach is currently successfully being adopted for several small satellite missions (Earth observation, deep space and other scientific missions).},

We mainly concentrate on concept selection methods because of their relevance in this company. The data presented is the result of qualitative research carried out during 4 years at {VCC}, where the authors were located as researchers. The research shows that many methods are employed besides those with an academic name, that some in-company methods used contain improvements to methods researched by academia, that some modifications to academic methods lead to unreliable results, and that there is a lack of objectivity in method modification.

A primary goal of {NODE} is to leverage commercially available technologies to provide a scalable and cost-effective alternative to radio-frequency-based communications. The {NODE} transmitter uses a 200-{mW} 1550-nm master-oscillator power-amplifier design using power-efficient M-ary pulse position modulation. To facilitate pointing the 0.12-deg downlink beam, {NODE} augments spacecraft body pointing with a microelectromechanical fast steering mirror ({FSM}) and uses an 850-nm uplink beacon to an onboard {CCD} camera. The 30-cm aperture ground telescope uses an infrared camera and {FSM} for tracking to an avalanche photodiode detector-based receiver. Here, we describe our approach to transition prototype transmitter and receiver designs to a full end-to-end {CubeSat}-scale system. This includes link budget refinement, drive electronics miniaturization, packaging reduction, improvements to pointing and attitude estimation, implementation of modulation, coding, and interleaving, and ground station receiver design.

	abstract = {In recent years, free space optical ({FSO}) communication has gained significant importance owing to its unique features: large bandwidth, license free spectrum, high data rate, easy and quick deployability, less power, and low mass requirements. {FSO} communication uses optical carrier in the near infrared band to establish either terrestrial links within the Earth's atmosphere or inter-satellite/deep space links or ground-to-satellite/satellite-to-ground links. It also finds its applications in remote sensing, radio astronomy, military, disaster recovery, last mile access, backhaul for wireless cellular networks, and many more. However, despite of great potential of {FSO} communication, its performance is limited by the adverse effects (viz., absorption, scattering, and turbulence) of the atmospheric channel. Out of these three effects, the atmospheric turbulence is a major challenge that may lead to serious degradation in the bit error rate performance of the system and make the communication link infeasible. This paper presents a comprehensive survey on various challenges faced by {FSO} communication system for ground-to-satellite/satellite-to-ground and inter-satellite links. It also provides details of various performance mitigation techniques in order to have high link availability and reliability. The first part of this paper will focus on various types of impairments that pose a serious challenge to the performance of optical communication system for ground-to-satellite/satellite-to-ground and inter-satellite links. The latter part of this paper will provide the reader with an exhaustive review of various techniques both at physical layer as well as at the other layers (link, network, or transport layer) to combat the adverse effects of the atmosphere. It also uniquely presents a recently developed technique using orbital angular momentum for utilizing the high capacity advantage of optical carrier in case of space-based and near-Earth optical communication links. This survey provides the reader with comprehensive details on the use of space-based optical backhaul links in order to provide high capacity and low cost backhaul solutions.},

Globally distributed {ChipSats} would enable datasets of unprecedented detail, assuming they could survive. The model presented is used to assess the survival and dispersion of a swarm of {ChipSats} when deployed over the Earth, Moon, Mars, and Titan. These planetary exploration case studies focus on the Monarch, the newest-generation {ChipSat} developed at Cornell University, in order to evaluate technology readiness for such missions. A parametric study is then conducted to inform future {ChipSat} design, highlighting the role of the ballistic coefficient in both peak entry temperature and mission duration.},

	abstract = {Model-Based Systems Engineering aims at creating a model of a system under development, covering the complete system with a level of detail that allows to define and understand its behavior and enables to define any interface and workpackage based on the model. Once such a model is established, further benefits can be reaped, such as the analysis of complex technical correlations within the system. Various insights can be gained by displaying the model as a formal graph and querying it. To enable such queries, a graph schema needs to be designed, which allows to transfer the model into a graph database. In the course of this paper, we discuss the design of a graph schema and {MBSE} modelling approach, enabling deep going system analysis and anomaly resolution in complex embedded systems. The schema and modelling approach are designed to answer questions such as what happens if there is an electrical short in a component? Which other components are now offline and which data cannot be gathered anymore? Or if a condition cannot be met, which alternative routes can be established to reach a certain state of the system. We build on the use case of qualification and operations of a small spacecraft. Structural and behavioral elements of the {MBSE} model are transferred to a graph database where analyses are conducted on the system. The schema is implemented by an adapter for {MagicDraw} to Neo4j. A selection of complex analyses are shown on the example of the {MOVE}-{II} space mission.},

	abstract = {In this Master Thesis we begin with a short analysis of the current space market, with the aim of searching solutions that allow us to implement femto-satellites (that is, satellites with a mass less than 100 grams) and mini-launchers (in this case less than 100 kilograms).

New synergies will be explored in order to reduce drastically the cost of development, construction, operation and disposal of femto-satellites and mini-launchers for operations in {LEO} (Low Earth Orbits below 300 kilometers of altitude) and short duration, about one week. http://code.google.com/p/moon-20

Two application examples based on current technologies that are not usually space compliance will be shown. The first example pretends to fulfill the N-Prize requirements and it is called {WikiSat}. The second example is an Earth observation application called {EPSCSat}.

The N-Prize is a competition that consists in putting into orbit a satellite of less than 20 grams with less than 10,000 sterling pounds of launch cost. This tiny satellite shall be tracked for at least nine turns around the Earth at a height in excess of 100 kilometers above the ground to qualify for the N-Prize.

The femto-satellite design will be extended to the {EPSCSat} and it is presented as an additional application of this work. The {EPSCSat} is a satellite with a camera, an optic for Earth observation and a fast download link thanks to the use of a radio-link in the S-Band.},

	abstract = {Traditionally, the space industry produced large and sophisticated spacecraft handcrafted by large teams of engineers and budgets within the reach of only a few large government-backed institutions. However, over the last decade, the space industry experienced an increased interest towards smaller missions and recent advances in commercial-off-the-shelf ({COTS}) technology miniaturization spurred the development of small spacecraft missions based on the {CubeSat} standard. {CubeSats} were initially envisioned primarily as educational tools or low cost technology demonstration platforms that could be developed and launched within one or two years. Recently, however, more advanced {CubeSat} missions have been developed and proposed, indicating that {CubeSats} clearly started to transition from being solely educational and technology demonstration platforms to offer opportunities for low-cost real science missions with potential high value in terms of science return and commercial revenue. Despite the significant progress made in {CubeSat} research and development over the last decade, some fundamental questions still habitually arise about the {CubeSat} capabilities, limitations, and ultimately about their scientific and commercial value. The main objective of this review is to evaluate the state of the art {CubeSat} capabilities with a special focus on advanced scientific missions and a goal of assessing the potential of {CubeSat} platforms as capable spacecraft. A total of over 1200 launched and proposed missions have been analyzed from various sources including peer-reviewed journal publications, conference proceedings, mission webpages as well as other publicly available satellite databases and about 130 relatively high performance missions were downselected and categorized into six groups based on the primary mission objectives including “Earth Science and Spaceborne Applications”, “Deep Space Exploration”, “Heliophysics: Space Weather”, “Astrophysics”, “Spaceborne In Situ Laboratory”, and “Technology Demonstration” for in-detail analysis. Additionally, the evolution of {CubeSat} enabling technologies are surveyed for evaluating the current technology state of the art as well as identifying potential areas that will benefit the most from further technology developments for enabling high performance science missions based on {CubeSat} platforms.},

	abstract = {Earth orbiting satellites come in a wide range of shapes and sizes to meet a diverse variety of uses and applications. Large satellites with masses over 1000 kg support high-resolution remote sensing of the Earth, high bandwidth communications services, and world-class scientific studies but take lengthy developments and are costly to build and launch. The advent of commercially available, high-volume, and hence low-cost microelectronics has enabled a different approach through miniaturization. This results in physically far smaller satellites that dramatically reduce timescales and costs and that are able to provide operational and commercially viable services. This paper charts the evolution and rise of small satellites from being an early curiosity with limited utility through to the present where small satellites are a key element of modern space capabilities.},

Later, agile development methodologies known as lightweight methodologies were introduced. Many considered these to be more flexible and more effective than heavyweight methodologies. Both methodologies are equally important for a software development life cycle. The purpose of adopting software development methodologies is to optimize the process model to achieve milestones while concurrently and effectively managing time, budget, and quality. The literature review reveals that there is a lack of statistical evidence for determining the effect of both methodologies on the six-pointed star model (schedule, scope, budget, risk, resource, and quality). In this paper, statistical comparisons were performed for the effects of both methodologies on each factor of the six-pointed star model and the interdependency among factors. Numerical analyses were conducted based on survey responses collected from the experienced users of both methodologies. After examining the results of all the factors of both methodologies, it was determined that lightweight methodologies are suitable for small-scale projects and that heavyweight methodologies perform better for mediumand large-scale projects.},

This is the result of a slow process of accretion through inclusion and interconnection of many notions, which came and are still coming from very different disciplines. The process started more than a century ago, but has gathered momentum since 1948 through the pioneering work of Wiener, von Neumann, von Bertalanffy, von Förster and Ashby, among many others. This paper tries to retrace the history of the accretion process and to show that our systemic and cybernetic language is an evolving conceptual network. This is of course only a first and quite incomplete attempt, merely destined to give the ‘feel’ of the process. Systemic concepts and models are underlined in order to enhance the perception of the process, as well as its systemic significance. Copyright © 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	doi = {10.1109/AERO.2017.7943648},
	abstract = {As a spacecraft becomes smaller, a number of physical effects scale both favorably and unfavorably for passive stabilization of the craft. Unfortunately, two separate quantities both scale unfavorably for the use of traditional spinning rotor actuators (e.g. reaction wheels, momentum wheels, control moment gyros) for momentum and attitude control. First, the dominant disturbance torques on small spacecraft in low earth orbit, aerodynamic drag and solar radiation pressure, both become relatively larger as spacecraft size decreases. Second, the effectiveness of spinning rotors reduces as the rotor inertia decreases with the square or the wheel radius. These two factors conspire to greatly reduce the effectiveness of rotor-based momentum control systems at small scales. This reduction requires small spacecraft designers to either devote a significantly larger mass fraction to momentum control or adopt alternative momentum control systems. In this study we examine this problem from two viewpoints. First, empirical data is used to find a relationship between spacecraft size and mass fraction devoted to attitude control. While the International Space Station can devote less than 1\% of its mass fraction to momentum control effectors, {GEO} telecom spacecraft tend to need around 1-2\% of available mass, and some {CubeSats} must devote greater than 50\% of their mass fraction. Second, we derive an expression for the smallest spacecraft that can use a reaction wheel for effective momentum management. For reasonable assumptions, this lower limit is on the order of 1 cm length scale, which is in good agreement with the empirical trend. Finally, we list some alternative momentum management strategies and discuss how they apply to spacecraft at the smallest size: the centimeter scale {ChipSat}.},

However, their low cost and short development cycle made nanosatellite constellations an affordable option for observing the Earth by remote sensing, increasing the frequency of high-resolution imagery, which is fundamental for studying and monitoring dynamic processes. In this sense, although still incipient, nanosatellite applications and proposed Earth observation missions are steadily growing in number and scientific fields. There are several initiatives from universities, space agencies and private companies to launch new nanosatellite missions. These initiatives are actively investigating new technologies to improve image quality and studying ways to increase acquisition frequency through the launch of larger constellations. So far, the private sector is leading the development of new missions, with proposals ranging from 12 to more than one thousand nanosatellite constellations. Furthermore, new nanosatellite missions have been proposed to tackle specific applications, such as natural disasters, or to test improvements on nanosatellite spatial, temporal and radiometric resolution. The unprecedented combination of high spatial and temporal resolution from nanosatellite constellations associated with improvement efforts in sensor quality is promising and may represent a trend to replace the era of large satellites for smaller and cheaper nanosatellites. This article first reports on the development and new nanosatellite missions of space agencies, universities and private companies. Then a systematic review of published articles using the most successful private constellation ({PlanetScope} and Doves) is presented and the principal papers are discussed.},

To obtain a better understanding of the current technology level and applications of nanosatellites and to spot trends in the global development and growth of such projects, a survey is performed including almost all launched pico- and nanosatellites. A key finding is that most subsystem technologies used are rather advanced, except for the attitude control systems and performance characteristics of subsystems that depend on attitude control.

Investigations revealed that the thermal balance of the system depended on the view factors, the energy converted by the solar cells into electricity, the rate at which the battery absorbs electricity and released it to the electronics, and the absorptivity and emissivity of the surfaces. The emissivity values were based on the values for solar cells instead of the values for crystalline silicon, as most of the usable surface was covered by the solar cells.},

Carried by micro and nano satellites, synthetic aperture radars ({SARs}) have great potential for urban, oceanography, land use, agriculture usages. Different than conventional satellites, the payload of Micro and nano satellites is limited. This imposes great challenges on the {SAR} system design. Traditional {SARs} adopt thousands of millimeter wave integrated circuit ({MMIC}) components; they are bulky and power hungry. This paper investigates the feasibility to deploy the emerging technologies to shrink the volume, reduce the cost and improve the power efficiency of the {SAR} system. Highly integrated radar transceiver integrated circuits ({ICs}) are reviewed, and a {SAR} transceiver {IC} is developed. Design technologies of low-noise amplifiers ({LNAs}) and high-power amplifiers ({HPAs}) are compared and Gallium Nitride ({GaN}) technology is proposed. A novel micro-electromechanical system ({MEMS}) based delay line is also proposed for satellite {SAR} to reduce the system size. Existing issues and expected improvements of these technologies are also elaborated. This work shows a clear route map for the future shrinkage of {SAR} system, and would be a useful guideline to the development of compact {SARs} for micro-satellites.},

This suggests that an extremely small body can efficiently aerobrake and aerocapture in the presence of an atmosphere. Likewise, aerothermal and radiative heat transfer scales according to characteristic length, such that sufficiently small bodies maintain lower quasi-equilibrium temperatures throughout an entry manoeuvre.

In an effort to exploit this unique feature of length scaling, the Space Systems Design Studio at Cornell University is developing an extremely small spacecraft dubbed “Sprite.” Simulations suggest that these lowcost spacecraft can re-enter Earth’s atmosphere from a
{LEO} orbit while maintaining a low enough temperature to continuously transmit data. The current printed circuit board prototype captures all of the intended functionality in the target application-specific

The ability to create distributed sensor networks through swarms of low-cost, low-mass spacecraft shall enable the exploration of asteroids, icy moons, and the Earths magnetosphere become more feasible. This research develops new techniques for analyzing swarm dynamics, both in the limited case of the Kepler problem, and in general gravity environments, investigates several techniques for providing chipsat propulsion, and develops possible mission strategies.
This work applies the Kustaanheimo-Stiefel ({KS}) transformation to the stochastic exploration presented by chipsat swarms. The contributions towards understanding swarm dynamics include analytical and numerical study of swarms in the purely Kepler problem as well as in general potential fields. A study of swarm evolution near an asteroid provides an example of the richness of behaviors that can be provided by chip-scale spacecraft swarms.
Swarm actuation can be achieved through a number of means. This research presents a novel attitude control and propulsion system for chipsat swarms near Earth using a mutliple electrodynamic tethers. A numerical study of tether configurations for the greatest control authority is also presented. In addition, active solar sails are evaluated for swarm actuation beyond Earth, and a visualization of available control authority is presented.
An example mission of swarm deployment near the Earth-Moon Lagrange point highlights the utility of swarm-based exploration. The candidate mission shows that a swarm with minimal actuation and a simple control scheme might provide distributed sensors in the region for a year or more, or dissipate quickly if uncontrolled. Such a chip-spacecraft mission would be a valuable precursor to further space development in these regions.},

	abstract = {The Dual Exploration Architecture is a mission concept that combines remote sensing and in-situ observations into a single mission to answer planetary science questions that can only be answered with both types of data. Adoption of dual exploration architectures may short circuit the long, slow cycle of missions to inaccessible bodies by eliminating the need for separate precursor and follow-up missions. Additionally, the dual architecture possesses inherent flexibility that enables the design of adaptive, event-driven missions. Five key observations about the state and trends of planetary science exploration lead us to the dual architecture: increasing complexity of observations, scarcity of future missions, desire to capture transitory events, continued miniaturization of components, and the Mars exploration cycle. A study of the planetary science the decadal survey reveals broad applicability of dual missions to solve mysteries that cannot be answered with a traditional mission architecture. These missions fall into three classes: choosing a local target from a global survey, dynamic/reactive science, and global in-situ networks. These mission classes further reveal four technology development needs that must be addressed for dual missions: passive landers, guided atmospheric probes, robust sensing packages, and small, precise orbital instruments. This study pursues a specific focus on two examples of such technologies: the {ChipSat} and cold atom gravimetry. Using these technologies, we study an example dual architecture mission to both characterize and sample the subsurface oceans at Europa. The identification of regions with thin ice precedes the selection of surface targets and dispatching of probes to those targets.},

	abstract = {Combining efficiency, simplicity, compactness, and high specific impulse, electrospray thrusters provide a unique solution to the problem of active control in the burgeoning field of miniature satellites. With the potential of distributed systems and low cost functionality currently being realized through development of increasingly smaller spacecraft, thruster research must adjust accordingly. The logical limit of this rapidly accelerating trend is a fully integrated silicon wafer satellite. Such a large surface area to volume ratio, however, both necessitates propulsion capability and renders other mechanisms of control unfeasible due to their respective form factors. While development of electrospray thrusters has exploded in the past two decades, current architectures are similarly incompatible with a silicon wafer substrate. This thesis examines the design and testing of a novel hybrid electrospray architecture which combines previous successes of both capillary and externally-wetted geometries. Our project achieved the first passively-fed, pure ionic emission with silicon emitters. More importantly the micro-manufacturing approach offers key advantages in flexibility and overall performance. Through adaption of a innovative approach to black silicon surface treatment, it is possible to tailor hydraulic impedance in order to maximize propellant flow rate and efficiency for a wide range of mission requirements. The manufactured design exhibits operation in the pure ionic mode with 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate and has an emitter density more than an order of magnitude larger than any previous electrospray architecture. Preliminary testing indicates that this will likely translate to a corresponding improvement in thrust density. Further, electrochemical degradation of emitter tips - a primary failure mechanism of electrospray thrusters - appears to occur at a relatively inconsequential rate.},

The presented approach combines the Time Difference Of Arrival ({TDOA}) and Angle Of Arrival ({AOA}) methods. We present the motivation, the envisioned solution together with the constraints for reaching it, and the best potential sensitivity of the location precision for different (1) deployment scenarios of the femto-satellite, (2) precisions in the location of the {CubeSats}, and (3) precisions in each {CubeSat}’s Attitude Determination and Control Systems ({ADCS}). We implemented a simulation tool to evaluate the average performance for different random scenarios in space. For the evaluated cases, we found that the Cramér-Rao Bound ({CRB}) for Gaussian noise over the small error region of the solution is highly dependent on the deployment direction, with differences in the location precision close to three orders of magnitude between the best and worst deployment directions. For the best deployment case, we also studied the best location estimation that might be achieved with the current Global Navigation Satellite System ({GNSS}) and {ADCS} commercially available for {CubeSats}. We found that the mean-square error ({MSE}) matrix of the proposed solution under the small error condition can attain the {CRB} for the simulated time, achieving a precision below 30 m when the femto-satellite is separated by around 800 m from the mother-{CubeSat}.},

The competition was launched in 2008 by Cambridge biologist Paul H. Dear, and is intended specifically to spur amateur involvement in spaceflight as it is "aimed at amateurs, enthusiasts, would-be boffins and foolhardy optimists."Dr. Dear died on 11 March 2020, and the prize was subsequently closed.
The challenge posed by the N-Prize is to launch a satellite weighing between 9.99 and 19.99 grammes into Earth orbit, and to track it for a minimum of nine orbits. Most importantly the launch budget must be under £999.99 including the launch vehicle, all of the required non-reusable launch equipment hardware, and propellant.In order to be eligible for the awards the challenge initially had to be completed before 19:19:09 ({GMT}) on 19 September 2013, however later it was decided that the prize will remain open until won. Doing so will earn the winning team a prize of £9,999.99.},

	abstract = {Femto-satellites have attracted growing attention over the past few years, with various universities taking up the challenge declared by the N-Prize. Many novel designs have been proposed, some of which are equipped with active attitude control based on either magnetic or electro-chromic control systems. However, conventional test platforms are unsuitable for testing control systems on such small length-scales and as such, developing suitable test platforms to be used for testing femto-satellite attitude control algorithms becomes important. This paper proposes six different concepts of laboratory-scale test platforms for femto-satellite attitude control testing, based on various physical laws. These platforms are manufactured using {SLA} 3D printing technology and then assembled. Qualitative observations are recorded and an experimental setup is devised in order to quantify the total resistive torque that appears in each platform. Results show that two of the designs display a maximum resistive torque on the order of 10{\textasciicircum}(-6) when spinning very rapidly, decreasing to the order of 10{\textasciicircum}(-7) at low angular velocities, which makes these designs suitable for their intended purpose. Finally, future work is proposed towards assessing the suitability of the other four platforms.},

	abstract = {Recent miniaturization of electronics in very small, low-cost and low-power configurations suitable for use in spacecraft have inspired innovative small-scale satellite concepts, such as {ChipSats}, centimeter-scale satellites with a mass of a few grams. These extremely small spacecraft have the potential to usher in a new age of space science accessibility. Due to their low ballistic coefficient, {ChipSats} can potentially be used in a swarm constellation for extended surveys of planetary atmospheres, providing large amounts of data with high reliability and redundancy. We present a preliminary feasibility analysis of a {ChipSat} planetary atmospheric entry mission with the purpose of searching for traces of microscopic lifeforms in the atmosphere of Venus. Indeed, the lower cloud layer of the Venusian atmosphere could be a good target for searching for microbial lifeforms, due to the favourable atmospheric conditions and the presence of micron-sized sulfuric acid aerosols. A numerical model simulating the planetary entry of a spacecraft of specified geometry, applicable to any atmosphere for which sufficient atmospheric data are available, is implemented and verified. The results are used to create a high-level design of a {ChipSat} mission cruising in the Venusian atmosphere at altitudes favorable for the existence of life. The paper discusses the {ChipSat} mission concept and considerations about the spacecraft preliminary design at system level, including the selection of a potential payload.},

	title = {Exploration Architecture with Quantum Inertial Gravimetry and In-Situ {ChipSat} Sensors},
	url = {https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20190001186},
	abstract = {The Dual Exploration Architecture is a mission concept that combines remote sensing and in-situ observations into a single mission to answer planetary science questions that can only be answered with both types of data. Adoption of dual exploration architectures may short circuit the long, slow cycle of missions to inaccessible bodies by eliminating the need for separate precursor and follow-up missions. Additionally, the dual architecture possesses inherent flexibility that enables the design of adaptive, event-driven missions that are very different from traditional, largely pre-planned missions. Five key observations about the state and trends of planetary science exploration lead us to the dual architecture: increasing complexity of observations; scarcity of future mission opportunities; desire to capture transitory events; continued miniaturization of spacecraft components; and the Mars exploration cycle. Our goal in this study is to explore missions that can only happen using the dual architecture concept and find technology development needs that must be filled for those missions to compete. A survey of historical and current missions finds that opportunities for exploration are becoming less frequent, causing the flexibility and dual-nature elements of each mission to become more common. The dual exploration architecture takes these trends to their far conclusion, attempting to eliminate precursor and follow-up missions while still returning more scientific payoff. A study of the future of planetary science goals through the decadal survey reveals broad applicability of dual missions to solve mysteries that cannot be answered with a traditional mission architecture. These missions fall into three broad classes: choosing a local target from a global survey; dynamic/reactive science; and global in-situ networks. Two example missions of each class are notionally described. A deeper look at these dual architecture classes reveals four technology development needs that must be addressed for wide adoption of dual missions: passive landers; guided atmospheric probes; robust sensing packages; and small, precise orbital instruments. This study pursues a specific focus on two examples of such enabling technologies: the {ChipSat} and cold atom gravimetry. The {ChipSat} is a fully functional spacecraft-on-a-chip system that has broad versatility in the dual architecture mission space. Initial studies show that {ChipSats} could survive as passive impactor landers on bodies up to the size of Europa. Furthermore, {COTS} (Commercial Off-The-Shelf) components could provide an in-situ sensor suite that readily answers a number of pressing planetary science questions. Cold atom gravimetry uses inertial sensors based on light-pulse atom interferometry in a small form factor to map the gravity field of a body to precision equaling what would normally require two full spacecraft to achieve. The cold atom gravimeter provides an example of how advanced remote sensing capability can enable dual missions by providing greater returns in a significantly smaller package. Using the above two technologies, we study an example dual-architecture mission to both characterize and sample the subsurface oceans at Europa. The greatest scientific return in terms of detecting extraterrestrial life is in those regions where Europa’s ice crust is thin. The identification of regions with thin ice should therefore precede the selection of surface targets and dispatch of probes to those targets. This two-step process, if accomplished by separate flagship-scale missions, might take decades. As a result, a combined mission to both identify thin areas of Europa’s ice and follow up with surface observations at those regions is a good candidate for the dual-exploration architecture. This example mission consists of an orbiter spacecraft carrying a cold atom gravimeter capable of sensing or inferring the ice thickness on regional to local scales, along with a number of {ChipSat} probes capable of landing on the moon. The small size and weight of the {ChipSats} allows large numbers of them to be carried, ensuring that enough can be dropped to ensure survival of a minimum number of probes and potentially allowing for the in-situ sampling of multiple locations on the moon. The example missions and Europa case study show that amazing scientific return can obtained from dual-exploration architecture missions with a single launch by breaking the long timescales of planetary exploration and providing the flexibility to capturing transitory events and collect data across the local, regional, and global scales.},

For a swarm of networked femto-spacecraft, relative position determination would be possible by inferring coarse range estimates from the received signal strength indication associated with the communication link between swarm members. This is particularly advantageous for highly resource-constrained devices. In this paper, algorithms for swarm relative positioning using interspacecraft range estimates are presented that can be applied to centralized, decentralized, and distributed network configurations. Relative navigation filters for initial relative orbit determination and state estimation are presented for femto-spacecraft swarm deployment and dispersal scenarios. The algorithms presented could also find use in terrestrial applications, in static and dynamic wireless sensor networks.},

	abstract = {Small satellite formation missions offer new options for space exploration and scientific 
experiments. Groups of satellites flying within short relative distances allow various 
important applications, such as spatially distributed instruments for atmospheric 
sampling or remote sensing systems. The ability to independently control the relative 
motion of each satellite is crucial to establish a swarm formation, using a large number of 
satellites moving along bounded relative trajectories. This type of mission poses several 
constraints on mass, size, and energy consumption; therefore, an autonomous and selfsufficient approach is necessary to assure relative motion control. A novel concept of 
miniaturized satellites, referred to as {ChipSats}, consists of a single printed circuit board 
which can be equipped with different sets of microelectronic components including power 
and communication systems, a variety of sensors, and a microcontroller. This study 
considers a swarm of {ChipSats} equipped with magnetorquers, operating at extremely 
short relative distances, and using the electromagnetic interaction force for relative 
motion and attitude control, assuming the absolute position and relative state of each unit 
is known. Despite the limitations imposed by using magnetorquers as the sole actuators 
onboard, the dipole interaction between drifting satellites can be used to achieve bounded 
relative trajectories, and to establish and maintain a compact swarm. Following a 
decentralized approach, the {ChipSats} are periodically linked in interchangeable pairs in 
order to apply the Lyapunov-based control algorithm and prevent relative drift between all 
satellites in the swarm. The magnetic dipole moments are used for angular velocity 
damping when orbit control is not required, and a repulsive collision avoidance 
electromagnetic control force is applied when two {ChipSats} are within dangerously close 
proximity to each other. The performance assessment is conducted through Monte Carlo 
simulations using {MATLAB}, by analyzing operational parameters and the effect of initial 
conditions after deployment.},

	abstract = {The past few decades have seen many meaningful trials on development of solar sail spacecraft with high area-to-mass ratios and thus allowing efficient, propellant-free photon propulsion. However, the restriction to bending stiffness of thin solar films has proven to be an obstacle for building solar sails with high area-to-mass ratios. This paper presents a novel design of micro solar sails for emerging lightweight chip scale spacecraft based on flexible electronics. A representative concept design of the chip scale solar sail spacecraft with area-to-mass ratios over 100 m²/kg is proposed, which enables efficient orbital transfer and attitude adjustment. To acquire large deformation for adjustment of forces, the micro solar sails consisting of bilayer beams are actuated by Joule heating. Electro-thermal analysis on the sails after deployed into space should be the prioritized and fundamental problem for following evaluation of deflection and thus change of solar radiation pressure on the reflective sails. Solar radiation, thermal reemission, and Joule heating are incorporated into the electro-thermal model for such solar sails deployed in geospace. A nonlinear second order differential equation is derived, which is solved numerically for temperature distribution across the sail. The proposed electro-thermal model is validated by finite element analysis and lays a solid foundation for the thermo-mechanical modelling, as well as flight modelling, of the chip scale spacecraft with such micro solar sails.},

	abstract = {The Breakthrough Starshot Initiative is suggested to develop the concept of propelling a nanoscale spacecraft by the radiation pressure of an intense laser beam. In this project, the nanocraft is a gram-scale robotic spacecraft comprising two main parts: {StarChip} and Lightsail. To achieve the goal of the project, it is necessary to solve a number of scientific problems. One of these tasks is to make sure that the nanocraft position and orientation inside the intense laser beam column are stable. The nanocraft driven by intense laser beam pressure acting on its Lightsail is sensitive to the torques and lateral forces reacting on the surface of the sail. These forces influence the orientation and lateral displacement of the spacecraft, thus affecting its dynamics. If unstable, the nanocraft might be expelled from the area of laser beam. In choosing the models for nanocraft stability studies, we are using several assumptions: (i) configuration of nanocraft is treated as a rigid body; (ii) flat or concave shape of circular sail; and (iii) mirror reflection of laser beam from surface of the Lightsail. We found conditions of position stability for spherical and conical shapes of the sail. The simplest stable configurations require the {StarChip} to be removed from the sail to make the distance to the center of mass of the nanocraft bigger than the curvature radius of the sail. Stability criteria do not require the spinning of the nanocraft. A flat sail is never stable. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {New means of interstellar travel are now being considered by various research teams, assuming lightweight spaceships to be accelerated via either laser or solar radiation to a significant fraction of the speed of light (c). We recently showed that gravitational assists can be combined with the stellar photon pressure to decelerate an incoming lightsail from Earth and fling it around a star or bring it to rest. Here, we demonstrate that photogravitational assists are more effective when the star is used as a bumper (i.e., the sail passes “in front of” the star) rather than as a catapult (i.e., the sail passes “behind” or “around” the star). This increases the maximum deceleration at α Cen A and B and reduces the travel time of a nominal graphene-class sail (mass-to-surface ratio ) from 95 to 75 years. The maximum possible velocity reduction upon arrival depends on the required deflection angle from α Cen A to B and therefore on the binary’s orbital phase. Here, we calculate the variation of the minimum travel times from Earth into a bound orbit around Proxima for the next 300 years and then extend our calculations to roughly 22,000 stars within about 300 lt-yr. Although α Cen is the most nearby star system, we find that Sirius A offers the shortest possible travel times into a bound orbit: 69 years assuming 12.5\% c can be obtained at departure from the solar system. Sirius A thus offers the opportunity of flyby exploration plus deceleration into a bound orbit of the companion white dwarf after relatively short times of interstellar travel.},

	abstract = {Microwave propelled sails are a new class of spacecraft using photon acceleration. It is the only method of interstellar flight that has no physics issues. Laboratory demonstrations of basic features of beam-driven propulsion, flight, stability ('beam-riding'), and induced spin, have been completed in the last decade, primarily in the microwave. It offers much lower cost probes after a substantial investment in the launcher. Engineering issues are being addressed by other applications: fusion (microwave, millimeter and laser sources) and astronomy (large aperture antennas). There are many candidate sail materials: carbon nanotubes and microtrusses, graphene, beryllium, etc. For acceleration of a sail, what is the cost-optimum high power system? Here the cost is used to constrain design parameters to estimate system power, aperture and elements of capital and operating cost. From general relations for cost-optimal transmitter aperture and power, system cost scales with kinetic energy and inversely with sail diameter and frequency. So optimal sails will be larger, lower in mass and driven by higher frequency beams. Estimated costs include economies of scale. We present several starship point concepts. Systems based on microwave, millimeter wave and laser technologies are of equal cost at today's costs. The frequency advantage of lasers is cancelled by the high cost of both the laser and the radiating optic.},

	abstract = {Breakthrough Starshot is an initiative to prove ultra-fast light-driven nanocrafts, and lay the foundations for a first launch to Alpha Centauri within the next generation. Along the way, the project could generate important supplementary benefits to solar system exploration. A number of hard engineering challenges remain to be solved before these missions can become a reality. A system model has been formulated as part of the Starshot systems engineering work. This paper presents the model and describes how it computes cost-optimal point designs. Three point designs are computed: A 0.2 c mission to Alpha Centauri, a 0.01 c solar system precursor mission, and a ground-based test facility based on a vacuum tunnel. All assume that the photon pressure from a 1.06 μm wavelength beam accelerates a circular dielectric sail. The 0.2 c point design assumes \$0.01/W lasers, \$500/m2 optics, and \$50/{kWh} energy storage to achieve \$8.0B capital cost for the ground-based beam director. In contrast, the energy needed to accelerate each sail costs \$6M. Beam director capital cost is minimized by a 4.1 m diameter sail that is accelerated for 9 min. The 0.01 c point design assumes \$1/W lasers, \$10k/m2 optics, and \$100/{kWh} energy storage to achieve \$517M capital cost for the beam director and \$8k energy cost to accelerate each 19 cm diameter sail. The ground-based test facility assumes \$100/W lasers, \$1M/m2 optics, \$500/{kWh} energy storage, and \$10k/m vacuum tunnel. To reach 20 km s-1, fast enough to escape the solar system from Earth, takes 0.4 km of vacuum tunnel, 22 {kW} of lasers, and a 0.6 m diameter telescope, all of which costs \$5M. The system model predicts that, ultimately, Starshot can scale to propel probes faster than 0.9 c.},

Self-replication would potentially allow for an exponential increase in the number of probes and thereby drastically improve the efficiency of space exploration. Despite this potential, an integrated assessment of self-replicating space probes has not been presented since the 1980s, and it is still unclear how far they are feasible. In this paper, we propose a concept for a partially self-replicating probe for space exploration based on current and near-term technologies, with a focus on small spacecraft. The purpose is to chart a path towards self-replication with near-term benefits, rather than attempting full self-replication. For this reason, components such as microchips and other microelectronic components are brought with the initial probe and are not replicated. We estimate that such a probe would be capable of replicating 70\% of its mass. To further increase this percentage, we identify technology gaps which may be usefully addressed. We conclude that small-scale, partially self-replicating probes are feasible near-term. Their benefits would become significant in exploration missions requiring in the order of a dozen of probes.},

This paper aimed at systematically reviewing the state of the art of continuous practices to classify approaches and tools, identify challenges and practices in this regard, and identify the gaps for future research. We used the systematic literature review method for reviewing the peer-reviewed papers on continuous practices published between 2004 and June 1, 2016. We applied the thematic analysis method for analyzing the data extracted from reviewing 69 papers selected using predefined criteria. We have identified 30 approaches and associated tools, which facilitate the implementation of continuous practices in the following ways: (1) reducing build and test time in continuous integration ({CI}); (2) increasing visibility and awareness on build and test results in {CI}; (3) supporting (semi-) automated continuous testing; (4) detecting violations, flaws, and faults in {CI}; (5) addressing security and scalability issues in deployment pipeline; and (6) improving dependability and reliability of deployment process. We have also determined a list of critical factors, such as testing (effort and time), team awareness and transparency, good design principles, customer, highly skilled and motivated team, application domain, and appropriate infrastructure that should be carefully considered when introducing continuous practices in a given organization. The majority of the reviewed papers were validation (34.7\%) and evaluation (36.2\%) research types. This paper also reveals that continuous practices have been successfully applied to both greenfield and maintenance projects. Continuous practices have become an important area of software engineering research and practice. While the reported approaches, tools, and practices are addressing a wide range of challenges, there are several challenges and gaps, which require future research work for improving the capturing and reporting of contextual information in the studies reporting different aspects of continuous practices; gaining a deep understanding of how software-intensive systems should be (re-) architected to support continuous practices; and addressing the lack of knowledge and tools for engineering processes of designing and running secure deployment pipelines.},

	abstract = {Space systems miniaturization has been increasingly popular for the past decades, with over 1600 {CubeSats} and 300 sub-{CubeSat} sized spacecraft estimated to have been launched since 1998. This trend towards decreasing size enables the execution of unprecedented missions in terms of quantity, cost and development time, allowing for massively distributed satellite networks, and rapid prototyping of space equipment. Pocket-sized spacecraft can be designed in-house in less than a year and can reach weights of less than 10g, reducing the considerable effort typically associated with orbital flight. However, while Systems Engineering methodologies have been proposed for missions down to {CubeSat} size, there is still a gap regarding design approaches for picosatellites and smaller spacecraft, which can exploit their potential for iterative and accelerated development. In this paper, we propose a Systems Engineering methodology that abstains from the classic waterfall-like approach in favor of agile practices, focusing on available capabilities, delivery of features and design "sprints". Our method, originating from the software engineering disciplines, allows quick adaptation to imposed constraints, changes to requirements and unexpected events (e.g. chip shortages or delays), by making the design flexible to well-defined modifications. Two femtosatellite missions, currently under development and due to be launched in 2023, are used as case studies for our approach, showing how miniature spacecraft can be designed, developed and qualified from scratch in 6 months or less. We claim that the proposed method can simultaneously increase confidence in the design and decrease turnaround time for extremely small satellites, allowing unprecedented missions to take shape without the overhead traditionally associated with sending cutting-edge hardware to space.},

	abstract = {The miniaturization of electronic components enables major reduction of spacecraft size and mass, as is the case of {CubeSats}, {PocketQubes}, and Femtosats, which offer shorter development time and costs, in comparison with traditionally larger satellites. However, these miniaturized satellites still require a considerable effort in terms of time and investment (several years of development, and costs around 10 5-10 6 {EUR} for {CubeSats}). More recently, an even smaller class of spacecraft, the Chipsats has been introduced. Chipsats are microchip-shaped spacecraft with masses ranging from a few grams to 10s of grams. At the lower end of the mass range (1-10 grams), they belong to the class of Attosats. Due to their small size, Attosats enable unprecedented low costs, agile development and potential for swarm missions of distributed and fractioned systems for applications such as planetary observation. However, despite their benefits there have not been many initiatives to develop Attosat systems. In this article, the development of a satellite system of three 10-grams satellites is presented. The three satellites work together to achieve the common goal of studying Earth's atmospheric environment, conforming a distributed system. Moreover, as the different satellites are designed to perform different functions, they conform a fractionated system as well: one satellite acts as a communication node transmitting data to ground stations, while the two other satellites have environment sampling capabilities. Visual intersatellite communication capabilities ensure data transmission among the satellites. The presented system is meant as a technology demonstration project for future distributed and fragmented satellite swarm systems for atmospheric planetary exploration. The Attosats are scheduled for launch on October 2023 on board of a Momentus spacecraft.},

Decisions at a given level of the architecture decomposition can result in the flowing down of conflicting requirements, which are easy to fulfill in isolation but extremely difficult when dealt with simultaneously. Designing against such sets of requirements considerably limits system affordability. Existing research on the evaluation of such conflicts primarily seek to determine the level of conflicts between pairs of requirements. We assert in this paper that these methods are incomplete and using traditional methodologies can result in missing significant conflicts between groups of requirements. We provide a mathematical proof for this assertion and present two case studies that support the mathematical proof. We present the concept of “order of conflict.” The objective of this paper is to prove why pairwise-based conflicting requirements identification and analysis methods based on pairwise comparisons are flawed.},

	abstract = {A new class of distributed space missions is emerging which requires hundreds to thousands of satellites for real-time, distributed, multi-point sensing to accomplish long-awaited remote sensing and science objectives. These missions, stymied by the lack of a low-cost mass-producible solution, can become reality by merging the concepts of distributed satellite systems and terrestrial wireless sensor networks. However, unlike terrestrial sensor nodes, space-based nodes must survive unique environmental hazards while undergoing complex orbital dynamics. A novel sub-kilogram very small satellite design is needed to meet these requirements. Sub-kilogram satellite concepts are developing elsewhere, such as traditional picosatellites and microengineered aerospace systems. Although viable technical solutions, these technologies currently come at a high cost due to their reliance on high-density technology or custom manufacturing processes. While evaluating these technologies, two untapped technology areas became evident that uniquely encompass low cost and mass producibility by leveraging existing commercial production techniques: satellite-on-a-chip ({SpaceChip}) and satellite-on-a-printed circuit board ({PCBSat}). This paper focuses on the design, build, and test results of a prototype {PCBSat} with a prototype unit cost less than \$300. The paper concludes with mission applications and future direction.},

By taking advantage of recent technological advancements in unrelated disciplines and taking a statistical approach to mission assurance, R-selected spacecraft open the door to an entirely new paradigm in space access and exploration. This dissertation describes the challenges and advantages unique to gram-scale, R-selected spacecraft. It also presents a number of use cases --- involving distributed in-situ sensing and planetary science --- that are unique to spacecraft of the Monarch's diminutive size and large quantity. This dissertation presents a routing policy for moving information through large collections of Monarchs in low-Earth orbit, and results from simulated lunar impact survival tests. Demonstrations of distributed sensing, leaderless cooperation, routing, and actuation are presented and discussed to illustrate the viability of some entirely new mission concepts.

Informed by an extensive review of existing literature, this paper establishes an interdisciplinary focus on the state-of-the-art technologies and compelling opportunities of {ChipSats}. Despite minimal functionality, short orbit lifetimes, and reduced regulation, {ChipSats} offer progression over present capabilities. This research is centered around cross-cutting considerations for the International Space University ({ISU}) to develop and launch {ChipSats} within five years. Existing technologies permit low-functionality payloads, where a 'Sputnik-like' mission with elementary communication functionalities serves as a pertinent precursor for {ISU}'s {ChipSat} mission. The delivery and launch of {ISU}'s own {ChipSat} through the proposed roadmap leans on three pillars: (1) the introduction of an {ISU} {ChipSat} laboratory; (2) regulatory guidance to outline the acceptable boundary conditions for {ChipSat} delivery and operation; and (3) space education and outreach. Technology gaps restrict payload selection, which impedes alternative space-borne applications, and persisting legal hurdles require resolution.

This paper introduces Stardust, a cluster of femto-satellites, to exploit their capacity of distributed measurement in the space. The design of Stardust consists of subsystems, space self-organized networking and thermal control. After the satellites were launched into the low earth orbit, experiments were carried out to verify the distributed measurement performance including multi-point wireless networking and measurement of the geomagnetic field. Results show that Stardust can work properly and effectively in a long period, which is proved to be a good reference for future femto-satellite design and space distributed measurement systems.},

Analogous to proliferating terrestrial wireless sensor networks, massively distributed sensor networks will enable the observation of real-time multi-point phenomenology. For example, an ionospheric plasma depletion sensor network would shed light on "plasma bubbles" accepted as the cause of satellite navigation and communication signal scintillation at low latitudes in the post-dusk sector. Economics dictate a low-cost, lass-producible sensor node for this prospective class of space mission. One promising concept is a satellite-on-a-printed circuit board ({PCBSat}), which leverages the multi-billion dollar infrastructure of the commercial {PCB} industry. The system configuration goals are: 10x10x2 cm and approximately 200 g mass, while supporting a small sensor, such as a Miniature Electrostatic Analyzer ({MESA}). Three interim stage prototype design cycles and partial environmental testing have been completed successfully. This paper briefly surveys distributed space missions and presents a complete mission architecture for the ionospheric plasma depletion study. Sub-kilogram very small satellite technologies are then discussed, followed by comparative cost modeling for commercial mass-production.

	abstract = {The rise of the consumer electronics industry has led to a profusion of ever smaller, cheaper, and more capable devices, from sensors to computers to radios. Many of these components are suitable for use in spacecraft. Their availability has led to the ongoing revolution in small satellites, most visibly exemplified by the {CubeSat} standard. This study seeks to push these trends toward their ultimate extreme: a satellite-on-a-chip. The ability to mass produce small, cheap, essentially disposable spacecraft has many implications for space exploration, Earth and atmospheric science, and education. New missions to characterize planetary surfaces and atmospheres, asteroids, and Earth's ionosphere could be planned using thousands of tiny spacecraft equipped with a variety of sensors. Such mission architectures would allow thousands of data points to be captured simultaneously across vast distances, offering unprecedented spatial resolution. Additionally, the cost of launching a satellite will be within reach for high schools, student groups, and even individual hobbyists, making space accessible to the general public in new ways. This dissertation documents the development of the Sprite centimeter-scale spacecraft, along with the associated hardware and software necessary for its deployment in low-Earth orbit and communication with ground stations. In addition, new solutions to several general spacecraft dynamics, control, and estimation problems with relevance to small and low-cost spacecraft are presented. These include  control laws for flat-spin recovery and spin inversion, an algorithm for on-orbit inertia estimation, and variational integrators for spacecraft attitude dynamics that offer improved performance over traditional Runge-Kutta schemes in spacecraft guidance, navigation, and control applications.},

	title = {Results and lessons learned from the {CubeSat} mission First-{MOVE}},
	abstract = {This paper presents the on-orbit results and the lessons learned from First-{MOVE} (Munich Orbital Verification Experiment), the first {CubeSat} mission of the Institute of Astronautics ({LRT}) at the Technische Universität München ({TUM}). The development of the satellite started as a student project in 2006. First-{MOVE} was launched on November 21st 2013. The student-designed and built satellite was operated for almost a month. On December 19th 2013 a major malfunction occurred, presumably due to an anomaly in the on-board data handling system ({OBDH}), which left the satellite in a mode where it is only transmitting continuous wave ({CW}) beacons. Although the short mission duration prevented several mission objectives from being achieved, the overall program can be considered a success, as it permitted more than 70 students hands-on experience and led to major in-house technology and spaceflight processing developments. The main aspects of a university-led satellite development, the results of the mission and both technical as well as educational lessons learned are described, including the management and planning of student projects as well as motivational and system engineering aspects. These aspects include planning the project around student's schedules rather than in a traditional, linear fashion, the careful selection and distribution of team members to subsystem teams and the deviation from traditional systems engineering process flows in order to retain student motivation. The importance of large milestone reviews and kick-off events as short term goals and as a means to recruit new team members are highlighted. Academic outreach programs included a one week summer school held in 2011 to recruit and train new students in a time-efficient setting in relevant technical aspects. The paper explains in more detail the technical lessons learned from the major satellite subsystems, both self-developed and purchased. The self-developed systems include, among others, the design of the solar-panel release mechanism, the unique {CMOS} latch-up protection system, the hard-command unit and the {OBDH} system. Although we can report a flawless function of all the purchased subsystems in-orbit, the detailed in-house system-level testing of these components is a major lessons learned of First-{MOVE} from the prospective of student education and system knowledge. Despite the existence of documentation, the time and knowledge needed for designing a test bed for the electric power system ({EPS}) and the subsequent testing was underestimated. Furthermore, from a testing prospective, the importance of integrated system-level testing and the need for longer, continuous operations test of the satellite are emphasized. On-orbit flight data, as well as educational lessons learned for efficient student involvement during mission operations are highlighted. An outlook to {MOVE} {II}, the follow-up satellite project of {LRT}, outlines how the lessons learned of the last generation students can be carried over and how they will influence future (student) satellite developments and spaceflight development processes at {LRT}.},

The satellite tested for these reported efforts was the {MOVE}-{II} {CubeSat}, developed at the Technical University of Munich since April 2015. The {HIL} environment has supported the development and verification of {MOVE}-{II}’s flight software and continues to aid the {MOVE}-{II} mission after its launch on 3 December 2018. The {HIL} environment allows the satellite to interact with a simulated space environment in real-time during on-ground tests. Simulated models are used to replace the satellite’s sensors and actuators, providing the interaction between the satellite and the {HIL} simulation. This approach allows for high hardware coverage and requires relatively low development effort and equipment cost compared to other simulation approaches. One key distinction from other simulation environments is the inclusion of the electrical domain of the satellite, which enables accurate power budget verification. The presented results include the verification of {MOVE}-{II}’s attitude determination and control algorithms, the verification of the power budget, and the training of the operator team with realistic simulated failures prior to launch. This report additionally presents how the simulation environment was used to analyze issues detected after launch and to verify the performance of new software developed to address the in-flight anomalies prior to software deployment.},

	abstract = {The {EECSat}, originally dubbed the Black Knight Sat, is a class of inexpensive and versatile nanosatellites called {CubeSats} that have the potential to further the United States and the United States Army’s dominance in space. This system is driven by inexpensive and commercially available parts with the intent to allow the United States Army to possess the capability to launch highly capable and specialized payloads to space to complete an array of missions. Equipped with a Raspberry Pi, a small commercially available computer, the {EECSat} has the potential to conduct onboard computations in space for a fraction of the cost compared to other large-scale satellites making the {EECSat} unique. Additionally, the {EECSat} is being developed to be a bus driven design. The bus driven design, another unique attribute of the {EECSat}, will serve as the constraints and requirements for future payloads in order to pioneer a standardized satellite platform. The {EECSat} project focused extensively on stakeholder analysis, research, problem definition, requirement generation, interdisciplinary collaboration, and documentation of the novel idea called {EECSat}.},

	url = {https://elib.dlr.de/136602/},
	abstract = {Modern satellite missions like {CubeSat}-missions are characterized by extremely short development time and significant low resource requirements. This can only be reached by reducing classical standards to necessary levels, tailored down for the respective mission. It leads to a rethinking of system engineering in modern space missions following the new space approach, which tailors down the standard processes to a minimum but reasonable level. 
The Optical Communication Systems Group ({OCS}) of {DLR} develops solutions to break the bottleneck caused by limited data-rates of traditional {RF}-communication systems with Free-Space-Optics ({FSO}) technologies for earth orbiting platforms. Therefore {DLR} started 10 years ago the {OSIRIS} (Optical Space {InfraRed} {downlInk} System) program which concentrates on research and development of laser communication terminals for Low-Earth-Orbit ({LEO}) satellites. The development speed in laser communication accelerated in the last years due to the availability of compact and low-cost flying platforms like pico- and nanosatellites. Therefore {OCS} follows the new space approach to shorten development times and finish projects much earlier compared to traditional space missions.
The {OSIRIS}4CubeSat (O4C) project has the goal to develop a high data-rate optical communication payload for {CubeSats} and demonstrates it in a quasi-operational scenario. The development of the payload is in close collaboration with Tesat-Spacecom who sells O4C under the name '{CubeLCT}' as a commercial product. Beside the payload development, the functionality of O4C will be demonstrated in a direct to earth downlink from a {CubeSat} to an Optical Ground Station. Thus, the payload will fly in the {PIXL}-1 mission on a 3U {CubeSat} built by {GomSpace}. After the Launch and Early Operational Phase ({LEOP}) the satellite will be hand over to German Space Operation Center ({GSOC}) to demonstrate for the first a time a commanding of a {CubeSat} by a professional Ground System. 
The ambitious path from the development of the payload, which started from scratch, to a quasi-operational mission, shows the necessity of a working system engineering to observe all requirements, coordinate the different teams and manage the interfaces to the stakeholder. This paper describes the system engineering based on the new space approach for a modern {CubeSat} mission. In the beginning of the project the overall requirements for the whole project were defined. This includes the technical requirements for the payload, to ensure the functionality depending on the extreme environmental conditions in space and the requirements for the satellite. Furthermore the operational requirements were defined. Additionally to the internal requirements the needs of the commercialization partner and the possible launch opportunities had to be considered.
Beside the requirements, the single work packages were defined to distinguish the several tasks and visualise the interfaces and connections in a work breakdown structure ({WBS}). Based on the {WBS} the technical teams for the development were formed. During the concept development and the integration of the payload, the system engineering had to monitor the requirements and coordinate the different technical teams with all their interfaces. Even though the teams were separated in optics, mechanics, electronics and software, their tasks were strongly connected. Beside the internal interface coordination the system engineering had to coordinate the communication on technical level to the external stakeholders like contractee (Tesat), satellite manufacturer ({GomSpace}), launch provider and operator ({GSOC}). 
This paper gives an overview over the processes in the {OSIRIS}4CubeSat project which represents modern system engineering following the new space approach.},

Comparison of high level features of {ADMs} with established systems engineering ({SE}) approaches reveals that there is significant commonality between them.

	abstract = {Hardware-in-the-loop test beds are applied in industrial satellite development to verify on-board software and to simulate operational scenarios. Spacecraft attitude sensors are simulated by models, which eliminate the need to stimulate them for closed loop scenarios. Similarly, attitude actuators are simulated including actuation interaction with spacecraft dynamics behavior. This approach leads to an enormous reduction in a spacecraft's verification time. Small satellites developed by organizations like {AMSAT} or by universities are even more limited with respect to available staff and thus even more constrained. As a consequence, there is a need to implement a comparable approach for a hardware-in-the-loop simulation environment at lower cost than in industrial development. The University of Stuttgart has developed and verified a hardware-in-the-loop system test bed for a small satellite's on-board computer while maintaining compliance to industrial standards. Further cost reduction was achieved by applying an industrial system simulation kernel, additional open-source software, the voluntary participation of students, and cooperation with the industry. The system simulation environment connected to the on-board computer was verified by comparing its results with dedicated simulation tools of several disciplines. The latency of signal transfers between the on-board software and the simulator in closed loop operation was determined and analyzed with respect to compliance to control loops and simulation step sizes. All results have been proven to be satisfactory for application in university satellite development and are presented in this publication. This setup is now used in the frame of the on-board software verification for the Flying Laptop satellite.},

This paper discloses the adaptation and application of concepts developed in agile software engineering to hardware product and system development for critical military applications. This challenging spacecraft did not use existing key technology (heritage hardware) and created a large paradigm shift from traditional spacecraft development. The insertion of new technologies and methods in space hardware has long been a problem due to long build times, the desire to use heritage hardware, and lack of effective process. The role of momentum in the innovative process can be exploited to tackle ongoing technology disruptions and allowing risk interactions to be mitigated in a disciplined manner. Examples of how these concepts were used during the {MBD} program will be delineated. Maintaining project momentum was essential to assess the constant non recurring technological challenges which needed to be retired rapidly from the engineering risk liens. Development never slowed due to tactical assessment of the hardware with the adoption of the {SCRUM} technique. We adapted this concept as a representation of mitigation of technical risk while allowing for design freeze later in the program's development cycle. By using Agile Systems Engineering and Management techniques which enabled decisive action, the product development momentum effectively was used to produce two novel space vehicles in a fraction of time with dramatically reduced cost.},

	abstract = {Annotation Clean code that works--now. This is the seeming contradiction that lies behind much of the pain of programming. Test-driven development replies to this contradiction with a paradox--test the program before you write it. A new idea? Not at all. Since the dawn of computing, programmers have been specifying the inputs and outputs before programming precisely. Test-driven development takes this age-old idea, mixes it with modern languages and programming environments, and cooks up a tasty stew guaranteed to satisfy your appetite for clean code that works--now. Developers face complex programming challenges every day, yet they are not always readily prepared to determine the best solution. More often than not, such difficult projects generate a great deal of stress and bad code. To garner the strength and courage needed to surmount seemingly Herculean tasks, programmers should look to test-driven development ({TDD}), a proven set of techniques that encourage simple designs and test suites that inspire confidence. By driving development with automated tests and then eliminating duplication, any developer can write reliable, bug-free code no matter what its level of complexity. Moreover, {TDD} encourages programmers to learn quickly, communicate more clearly, and seek out constructive feedback. Readers will learn to: Solve complicated tasks, beginning with the simple and proceeding to the more complex.Write automated tests before coding.Grow a design organically by refactoring to add design decisions one at a time.Create tests for more complicated logic, including reflection and exceptions.Use patterns to decide what tests to write.Create tests using {xUnit}, the architecture at the heart of many programmer-oriented testing tools. This book follows two {TDD} projects from start to finish, illustrating techniques programmers can use to easily and dramatically increase the quality of their work. The examples are followed by references to the featured {TDD} patterns and refactorings. With its emphasis on agile methods and fast development strategies, Test-Driven Development is sure to inspire readers to embrace these under-utilized but powerful techniques. 0321146530B10172002.},

	abstract = {Both startups and traditional space industry are exploring new business opportunities and new engineering approaches in what is becoming known now as New Space. Organizations started accelerating project schedules and challenging the V-model typically used in space product development. The need of a faster and more adaptive response to changing customer needs within an improved development productivity made Agile process a potential key enabler of New Space sector. On the other hand, space system projects are typically executed in multi-party consortia. Each organization in a consortium adopts its own product development process and interprets “New Space” differently. For this reason, the implementation of Agile is not seamless as it requires coordination with traditional systems engineering approaches. This setup is what we refer to as “hybrid Agile product development process”. This paper provides a first definition of the architecture of hybrid product development process targeted toward systems development and lifecycle management of hardware projects developed by multi-party consortia. We consider this discussion in the context of the development of spaceflight hardware in the New Space industry. We identify the main challenges in adopting such a methodology in developing hardware systems. This work identifies opportunities of future work for defining coordination approaches in hybrid product development settings, and improved organization structures of hardware projects in hybrid development contexts.},

	abstract = {In the last decades, agile methods had a huge impact on how software is developed. In many cases, this has led to significant benefits, such as quality and speed of software deliveries to customers. However, safety-critical systems have widely been dismissed from benefiting from agile methods. Products that include safety critical aspects are therefore faced with a situation in which the development of safety-critical parts can significantly limit the potential speed-up through agile methods, for the full product, but also in the non-safety critical parts. For such products, the ability to develop safety-critical software in an agile way will generate a competitive advantage. In order to enable future research in this important area, we present in this paper a mapping of the current state of practice based on a mixed method approach. Starting from a workshop with experts from six large Swedish product development companies we develop a lens for our analysis. We then present a systematic mapping study on safety-critical systems and agile development through this lens in order to map potential benefits, challenges, and solution candidates for guiding future research.},

Although proximate causes of failure are often technical, root causes are usually mismanagement of the social context, leading to human error. Thus, while needing to maintain safety standards and faced with budgetary cuts and industry globalization, the space industry is driven to consider alternate methodologies by which to achieve success and limit failure. While Agile practices produce much interest within all aspects of mission-critical systems engineering, there is not much supporting data with respect to specific applicability of practices within the space industry. The need to review space-based systems engineering methodologies and to contemplate the applicability of disparate software engineering techniques, such as Agile, motivates the following research objective: The goal of this research is to identify which Agile practices, if any, are desirable and suitable for space-based systems engineering. Although some Agile practices may be discarded outright, others seem quite useful and should be given consideration. Scrum and extreme Programming ({XP}) show particular potential as does practicing hybrid approaches that combine Agile practices with existing formal methodologies and engineering standards.},

	rights = {In Copyright - Educational Use Permitted},
	url = {https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/139865},
	abstract = {Design reuse is a common practice in the space industry — stemming from a desire by engineers and managers to realize cost and schedule benefits while buying down risk with proven designs. Legacy design reuse, specifically, is characterized by its opportunistic nature compared to more intentional platform-based reuse. However, legacy reuse decisions made during preliminary phases of an architecting effort are often overly optimistic regarding potential benefits. This can lead to reuse scenarios that either do not fully realize expected benefits, or result in detrimental impacts or even mission failure. 
 
This work presents a remedy in the form of the Legacy Design Reuse in {MBSE} ({LDRM}) methodology. It is a systematic approach for conducting technical and programmatic analyses for informing legacy reuse decisions in the early design phases of a mission. {LDRM} incorporates design reuse best practices and process improvements derived from a survey of industry practitioners. The resulting procedure is implemented in a Model-based Systems Engineering ({MBSE}) environment in order to leverage the integrated, authoritative, and curated data landscape of this new paradigm. Key outputs of {LDRM} are: a) assessment of reuse feasibility of a candidate design, b) enumeration of the required rework/adaptation effort, and c) estimate of the reuse scenario’s cost or schedule impacts versus a comparable from-scratch effort - using the {COSYSMO} 2.0 parametric cost modeling tool. 
 
A sample design problem demonstrates application of {LDRM} to evaluate reuse of the robotic arm design of the Curiosity rover on Luna, a hypothetical lunar rover. The Luna design case is carried into a two-phase virtual Lego design/build/reuse validation experiment. Decision-making performance of study participants with access to {LDRM} outputs is improved by close to 30\% over a control group. {LDRM} is then applied to two industry case studies. The first, reuse of the bus subsystems across the {AeroCube} 10 and {DAILI} {CubeSat} missions, demonstrates nominal procedures and outcomes for 3 of 4 subsystems explored; model incompatibilities in the attitude control system led to recommendations to the sponsor for improvements to {MBSE} model practices and curation. The second case study, exploring congressionally-mandated reuse in {NASA}’s {SLS} vehicle, finds reuse limitations in the Core Stage engine section borrowed from the Space Shuttle program. {LDRM} predicts a 43\% increase in systems engineering effort due to extensive interface rework of engine section components. These real-world findings suggest that decision support tools, like {LDRM}, can improve legacy reuse outcomes in the next generation of space systems.},

To answer these challenges, engineers have always reused their know-how. However, facing today's rising complexity, reuse has to be much more performant. That is why models supported by formal or semiformal languages are preferred to avoid the variability of natural languages interpretation. In this context, model-based systems engineering ({MBSE}) made it possible to change the engineering paradigm by proposing a unique, shared system model. To promote and ease {MBSE} adoption, reuse should be fostered to respect the engineer's working method. A promising method for reusing models is based on the pattern concept.

Addressing these challenges requires a holistic approach to the specification of the system design. To this end, we explore the use of model-based systems engineering ({MBSE}) principles in mitigating the design complexity of the {PL} architecture for the {VLC} system. Design concerns and gaps are addressed by developing an executable black-box system model that specifies the conceptual architecture of the system, and a parametric model that analyzes multiple system configurations based on generated values for the signal-to-noise ratio and bit error rate parameters. We utilize the structural, behavioral, and parametric semantics of {SysML} to define, specify, visualize, and analyze the various system design configurations.

Within the systems engineering community, there has been a realization that organizations optimize individual systems performance and manage system-specific cost, schedule and risks, with comparatively little regard to the holistic System-of-Systems ({SOS}) context. Optimization of individual satellite and homogeneous constellation design parameters have been well documented in literature. We expand extant techniques to the larger {SoS} context, with the potential to realize efficiencies by synthesizing and evaluating a larger design space. Using genetic algorithms, the method models a disaggregate space system as a combinatorial optimization problem. The combination of potential large satellites and small satellites are evaluated for cost effectiveness. Cost coefficients are derived from a variety of cost models, and overall effectiveness of a design alternative is provided through integrated simulation and optimization routines. We apply the proposed method to determine the optimal mix of space-based systems in an example remote sensing earth observation scenario.},

Since agile methods have been successfully applied within software development our hypothesis is that they could also be successfully applied within Systems Engineering. Our study focuses on 6 specific agile practices and their ability to improve customer satisfaction in complex hard- and software projects. It is shown that some of them have a positive effect on customer satisfaction but we do not find evidence for others.},

	abstract = {Context Safety-critical software systems are increasingly being used in new application areas, such as personal medical devices, traffic control, and detection of pathogens. A current research debate is regarding whether safety-critical systems are better developed with traditional waterfall processes or agile processes that are purportedly faster and promise to lead to better products. Objective To identify the issues and disputes in agile development of safety-critical software and the key qualities as found in the extant research literature. Method We conducted a systematic literature review as an interpretive study following a research design to search, assess, extract, group, and understand the results of the found studies. Results There are key issues and propositions that we elicit from the literature and combine into a conceptual model for understanding the foundational challenges of agile software development of safety-critical systems. The conceptual model consists of four problematic practice areas and five relationships, which we find to be even more important than the problematic areas. From this review, we suggest that there are important research gaps that need to be investigated. Conclusions We suggest that future research should have a primary focus on the relationships in the resulting conceptual model and specifically on the dynamics of the field as a whole, on incremental versus iterative development, and on how to create value with minimal but sufficient effort.},

	abstract = {From 1992 until 1999, {NASA} adopted a Faster-Better-Cheaper ({FBC}) paradigm-i.e., smaller low-cost spacecraft-for its unmanned missions. When many early missions met their objectives at much lower cost than traditional flagship missions, the {FBC} approach seemed successful. However, after the failures of two Mars spacecraft in 1999, the {FBC} paradigm was viewed as a failed experiment. We reflect on the legacy of {FBC}. In particular, we focus on the organizational learning literature to explore whether {FBC}, a stretch goal, was a good step for {NASA}. Previous examinations of {FBC} have focused on failure rates rather than on cost effectiveness. We revisit the question of {FBC} by examining all unmanned {NASA} missions launched between 1974 and 2007. We find that {FBC} missions resulted in more scientific publications per dollar of mission cost than other types of missions. From our analysis, we perceive lasting benefits to current projects from the adoption of the stretch goals, and perceive that {NASA} suffers from a bias against learning from the {FBC} experiment because of the stigma of the high-profile failed projects. We conclude with the recommendation that {NASA} should challenge itself with stretch goals, but with science goals rather than human exploration goals.},

In fact, {MBSE} remains a central element in the International Council on Systems Engineering ({INCOSE})’s vision for 2025. Examining systems engineering literature, this paper presents an assessment of the extent to which benefits and value of {MBSE} are supported by empirical evidence. A systematic review of research and practice papers in major systems engineering archival journals and conference proceedings was conducted. Evidence was categorized in four types, two of which inductively emerged from the results: measured, observed (without a formal measurement process), perceived (claimed without evidence), and backed by other references. Results indicate that two thirds of claimed {MBSE} benefits are only supported by perceived evidence, while only two papers reported measured evidence. The aggregate assessment presented in this paper indicates that claims about the value and benefits of {MBSE} are mainly based on expectation. We argue that evidence supporting the value and benefits of {MBSE} remains inconclusive.},

When a local task is completed, its output is integrated through an iterative cycle of system-wide integration activities. Integration is often accompanied by inadvertent information hiding due to the asynchronous information exchanges. We show that information hiding leads to persistent recurrence of problems (termed the design churn effect) such that progress oscillates between being on schedule and falling behind. The oscillatory nature of the {PD} process confounds progress measurement and makes it difficult to judge whether the project is on schedule or slipping. We develop a dynamic model of work transformation to derive conditions under which churn is observed as an unintended consequence of information hiding due to local and system task decomposition. We illustrate these conditions with a case example from an automotive development project and discuss strategies to mitigate design churn.},

	abstract = {Design information of a spacecraft is collected over all phases in the lifecycle of a project. A lot of this information is exchanged between different engineering tasks and business processes. In some lifecycle phases, model-based system engineering ({MBSE}) has introduced system models and databases that help to organize such information and to keep it consistent for everyone. Nevertheless, none of the existing databases approached the whole lifecycle yet. Virtual Satellite is the {MBSE} database developed at {DLR}. It has been used for quite some time in Phase A studies and is currently extended for implementing it in the whole lifecycle of spacecraft projects. Since it is unforeseeable which future use cases such a database needs to support in all these different projects, the underlying data model has to provide tailoring and extension mechanisms to its conceptual data model ({CDM}). This paper explains the mechanisms as they are implemented in Virtual Satellite, which enables extending the {CDM} along the project without corrupting already stored information. As an upcoming major use case, Virtual Satellite will be implemented as {MBSE} tool in the S2TEP project. This project provides a new satellite bus for internal research and several different payload missions in the future. This paper explains how Virtual Satellite will be used to manage configuration control problems associated with such a multi-mission platform. It discusses how the S2TEP project starts using the software for collecting the first design information from concurrent engineering studies, then making use of the extension mechanisms of the {CDM} to introduce further information artefacts such as functional electrical architecture, thus linking more and more processes into an integrated {MBSE} approach.},

The formal specifications are implemented for five data formats of the experiment and provide automatic generation of source code for data reading libraries in target programming languages (e.g. C++, Java, and Python). These libraries were tested on {TAIGA} data. They showed a good performance and help us to locate the parts with corrupted data. The format specifications can be used as metadata for exchanging of astroparticle raw data.

	abstract = {This research conducts a broad systems-based analysis of {CubeSat} engineering, with a focus on testing, failures, and their relationship to program cost, in order to assess multiple build approaches with a goal of maintaining the advantages of {CubeSat} missions while increasing reliability. In this work, the multiple approaches are called "beta build strategies," and we show that satellite engineering groups with minimal experience can increase their probability of success by building two flight-model versions of their satellite, allowing for more exhaustive and potentially failure-inducing testing to be conducted on the first (beta version) satellite. This differentiates itself from the standard {CubeSat} build approach, which is typically to build a flat sat, then an engineering model, and then a flight model of the satellite. Frequently with {CubeSat} development, the additional expense of building a flight-like engineering model is avoided. However, in this work we consider the probability of success and overall cost impact for multiple approaches toward the flight build. We find that by spending an additional 33\% of the planned program cost, a team which plans to take this alternate approach from the beginning can build and launch two flight-model versions of their spacecraft, increasing probability of success by 30\%. This cost corresponds to a 40\% saving from the scenario in which the decision to build a second flight-model spacecraft is made only after the first fails. The question which this analysis tries to answer is not, "how does a group spend the least amount of money to get their first {CubeSat} into space?" but rather, "how does a group spend the least amount of money to get a {CubeSat} into space that works?"},

	title = {Special Characteristics of Concurrent Engineering Studies dealing with Cubesat missions and their impact on the {CE} process},
	url = {https://elib.dlr.de/105553/},
	abstract = {The continuously growing commercial and scientific relevance of nanosatellite missions, especially Cubesats, is clearly discernible in the space community. Due to this, it is important to analyse the special characteristics and demands of early phase studies for such missions to consider them in the Concurrent Engineering Facility ({CEF}), {DLR} Bremen’s system analysis laboratory. Within such studies, various differences have been observed which make it necessary to adapt the established {CE} process for study preparation, conduction and post-processing to meet the specific demands of these well-constrained systems, and thereby create the optimal study results together with the design team.
On the design level, the major differences can mainly be traced to two closely connected peculiarities of {CubeSat} design. First, the targeted system is strictly limited in size, mass and form factor by the associated standard. Because of this, and the growing acceptance of Cubesats, a wide set of highly integrated {COTS} components and complete subsystems exists on the market with detailed datasheets, and even 3D models freely available on the internet. Secondly, this pool of applicable hardware increases the level of detail the study team has to deal with in a {CE} study, sometimes even down to connector and harness layout.
In a nutshell, the process of {CE} studies has to be adapted for these small systems towards a later-phase like level of detail, while preserving the creative and efficient way of solution finding traditionally associated with the {CE} process, including known benefits such as time and cost savings, and design quality improvement. Based on conducted {CE} studies for {CubeSat} missions, this paper points to some of the most noticeable and important lessons learnt and derives suggestions for possible process adaptations.
One of a {CE} study’s team leader’s main tasks is to make sure the design process is followed in the most efficient way possible. However, different activities or designs require at times a different approach and ad hoc modifications to the traditional {CE} process. Starting with the findings from the Cubesat experience, it becomes more and more obvious that the proven process and work approach has to be adapted not only depending on the type of activity conducted in the {CEF} but also on the design team’s background and composition. To exemplify this, the differences for “regular” and {CubeSat} studies, plus less strictly defined moderated workshops, are analysed in this paper with a special focus on the most promising particular respective communication and guidance styles of the team leaders, as experienced in the {CEF}.},

	abstract = {{CubeSats} are widely used by universities and research institutions all over the world. Their popularity is generally attributed to the use of low-cost components, free student labor and simple design. They have been shown to encourage Science, Technology, Engineering and Math ({STEM}) students to become involved in designing, implementing and testing a real functioning spacecraft system. Projects like this encourage students from different disciplines to team up to design and build {CubeSats}, providing interdisciplinary work experience. Participating students vary in their expertise in developing such systems. Some will work on the project for years while others are not willing to spend two or three consecutive semesters developing a {CubeSat} project. Despite their simplicity in design and low cost, {CubeSats} are considered great engineering systems for exploring space. Nevertheless, a large number of {CubeSat} projects fail due to having an unclear mission, ambiguous system requirements and a lack of documentation. Students need to have a clear vision of how to build a real {CubeSat} system that can be launched and that can function in space. Thus, this paper proposes engineering methodologies and tools to help students develop {CubeSat} systems. These tools can help students with planning, collecting, eliciting and documenting the requirements in a well-defined manner. This paper focuses on student-driven {CubeSat} projects designed by students and faculty members. Additionally, data is presented in this paper to identify the challenges and needs of {CubeSat} developers. Plans for future work are also discussed.},

	abstract = {With an increase in the use of small, modular, resource-limited satellites for Earth orbiting applications, the benefit to be had from a model-based architecture that rapidly searches the mission trade-space and identifies near-optimal designs is greater than ever. This work presents an architecture that identifies trends between conflicting objectives (e.g. lifecycle cost and performance) and decision variables (e.g. orbit altitude and inclination) such that informed assessment can be made as to which design/s to take on for further analysis. The models within the architecture exploit analytic methods where possible, in order avoid computationally expensive numerical propagation, and achieve rapid convergence. Two mission cases are studied; the first is an Earth observation satellite and presents a trade-off between ground sample distance and revisit time over a ground target, given altitude as the decision variable. The second is a satellite with a generic scientific payload and shows a more involved trade-off, between data return to a ground station and cost of the mission, given variations in the orbit altitude, inclination and ground station latitude. Results of each case are presented graphically and it is clear that non-intuitive results are captured that would typically be missed using traditional, point-design methods, where only discrete scenarios are examined.},

	abstract = {Space is hard” often gets translated to “Space technology is hard”. This mindset disregards some of the critical aspects of developing, deploying and operating a Cubesat constellation. Throughout this paper, we walk through what Spire has undertaken to get a commercial satellite constellation up and running. To enable both scale and rapid technology iteration, the design processes and systems have evolved to be lean but reliable. An iterative systems engineering approach ensures the necessary control, speed and reliability as features are added to the constellation. Solid process control and an experienced manufacturing team ensure reliable, repeatable and rapid satellite Assembly, Integration and Testing ({AIT}). A global groundstation network provides full control in accessing the satellite data. Complex software systems are in place to orchestrate the space and ground assets, to extract maximum customer value and provide the mission flexibility that’s needed in rapidly changing market environments. An efficient satellite operations team monitors and responds to the changing behaviors of the constellation. All of these factors together comprise a system that can be leveraged to enable other businesses to be successful as well without having to build and maintain all this infrastructure, as the importance of the space-as-a-service concept grows.},

Given the 40\% failure rate of university missions, it is important to discover what project arrangements may give the {CubeSat} the best chance of success. The aim of this paper is to offer those wishing to start a {CubeSat} program some indications of what successful project management at a university may look like. This paper provides case studies of 3 universities who have launched more than 4 satellites: University of Michigan, the Montana State University, and Aalborg University in Denmark. The information was gathered by asking supervisors from these teams a series of questions relating to project management. These included team structure, continuity, how the students organize themselves, how much of the work is embedded in the curriculum, how new students were integrated and how documentation was used to manage the project. The different methods of organization used in the different programs were described with their unique features. After this, both the variation and the common elements were identified. It is hoped that this research will contribute to successful {CubeSat} projects in universities worldwide.},

The {CSRM} is based on Model-Based System Engineering ({MBSE}) principles, is System Modeling Language ({SysML}) compliant, is hosted in a graphical modeling tool, and is intended to foster completeness and economies of scale associated with reusability. The {CSRM} has been vetted by System Engineering professionals and has been introduced to the {CubeSat} mission development team community with favorable results. The {CSRM} has been submitted to the Object Management Group ({OMG}) as a {CubeSat} specification, and is being evaluated for that role. Mission Engineering, a concept where the mission itself is looked at as a system is being explored as a means to maintain balance between the spacecraft system, operations (including ground systems), and the mission (the integration of needed capabilities). Now opportunities exist to extend the already-developed {CSRM} to enable the application of Mission Engineering to modeling a complete {CubeSat} mission. This paper presents the challenges and approach that the {INCOSE} {SSWG} will address, including a path for extension of the {CRSM} for use in exploring its applicability to the Mission Engineering concept, and capturing the Mission as a Model to create a unifying environment for universities to build on each other's successes as they learn to design for Space.},

people worldwide understand Scrum. We have evolved the Guide since then through small, functional
updates. Together, we stand behind it.
The Scrum Guide contains the definition of Scrum. Each element of the framework serves a specific
purpose that is essential to the overall value and results realized with Scrum. Changing the core design
or ideas of Scrum, leaving out elements, or not following the rules of Scrum, covers up problems and
limits the benefits of Scrum, potentially even rendering it useless.
We follow the growing use of Scrum within an ever-growing complex world. We are humbled to see
Scrum being adopted in many domains holding essentially complex work, beyond software product
development where Scrum has its roots. As Scrum’s use spreads, developers, researchers, analysts,
scientists, and other specialists do the work. We use the word “developers” in Scrum not to exclude,
but to simplify. If you get value from Scrum, consider yourself included.
As Scrum is being used, patterns, processes, and insights that fit the Scrum framework as described in
this document, may be found, applied and devised. Their description is beyond the purpose of the
Scrum Guide because they are context sensitive and differ widely between Scrum uses. Such tactics for
using within the Scrum framework vary widely and are described elsewhere},

These five themes include: flexiblity, chunkability, scalability, endurability, and teamability. These five themes further are found related to the defining principles of the agile manifesto. Using this understanding, future efforts will include empirical case study work to determine the impact that these have on application of scrum methods and tools.

The host mission is a collaboration with several partners including academia and small and medium enterprises. Scrum is a product development process created as a faster, more effective way of developing software. The goal of our investigation is to understand whether and by how much the same Scrum principles that proved successful in software can be adopted vis-à-vis in hardware projects. We also intend to identify the fundamental challenges in such an approach for space missions. In the host mission, Scrum has been adopted for the development of the payload subject to the investigation. The paper introduces the ongoing development process and identifies Scrum-related challenges internal to the payload development and challenges related to the coordination of the process with partners adopting established development processes. The paper identifies opportunities of future work for the fine tuning of Agile development methodologies in space projects and illustrates key statistics that have been collected throughout the development so far.},

These variables (or parameters) include the {LED} transmit power, photodetector active area, receiver bandwidth and link distance. One of the most important tasks for the visible light communication ({VLC}) system designer is how to ensure the required balance or trade-off among these variables in order to achieve the desired performance. In this work, we employed multi-objective optimization to determine physical layer design variables at which the signal-to-noise ratio ({SNR}) at the {VLC} receiver is maximized. We used the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm {II} ({NSGA}-{II}) in {MATLAB} to determine the Pareto front of two conflicting objective functions, and then extracted the optimal solution using the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution ({TOPSIS}). Analysis of the optimal solution showed that it yielded the maximum {SNR} within the set of non-dominated solutions at the Pareto front. We showed that using multi-objective optimization techniques for assignment of parameter values can yield more than 3 {dB} improvement in the {SNR}.},

This work summarizes ten years of developments, ranging from basic optoelectronic parts and front-end electronics, to different inorbit demonstrations. Several wireless applications were carried out in representative environments at ground level, and on in-flight experiments. A completely wireless satellite will be launched at the beginning of 2010. The benefits of replacing standard data wires and connectors with wireless systems are: mass reduction, flexibility, and simplification of the Assembly, Integration and Tests phases ({AIT}). However, the Aerospace and Defense fields need high reliability solutions. The use of {COTS} (Commercial-Off-The- Shelf) parts in these fields require extensive analyses in order to attain full product assurance. The current commercial optical wireless technology needs a deep transformation in order to be fully applicable in the aforementioned fields. Finally, major breakthroughs for the implementation of optical wireless links in Space will not be possible until dedicated circuits such as mixed analog/digital {ASICs} are developed. Once these products become available, it will also be possible to extend optical wireless links to other applications, such as Unmanned Air and Underwater Vehicles ({UAV} and {UUV}). The steps taken by {INTA} to introduce Optical Wireless Links in the Space environment are presented in this paper.},

However, the limited number of studies concerned with the suitability of Commercial-off-the-shelf ({COTS}) supercapacitors to withstand the launch and space environment has hindered the practical use of supercapacitors on-board satellites. To contribute to studies that support the feasibility of using supercapacitors in small spacecraft, two goals are pursued: First, to demonstrate that a supercapacitor can survive the launch. Second, to prove that charging and discharging a supercapacitor in Low Earth Orbit ({LEO}) is possible. Three charge-discharge cycles of the supercapacitor in {LEO} have been recorded over the time-span of five months from the launch, and are compared to ground results. In addition, self-discharge over two days in orbit has been calculated as less than 2.5\%. These results show that the {COTS} supercapacitor can withstand the launch and space environment with capacitance loss lower than 1\% and, therefore, is a viable energy storage device for {LEO} satellites. However, degradation of the supercapacitor over longer stays in orbit and repeated cycling is yet to be characterised.},

One compelling area of current space research is the design of miniaturized satellites, known as {CubeSats}, which are enticing because of their numerous applications and low design-and-deployment cost. The new paradigm of connected space through {CubeSats} makes possible a wide range of applications, such as Earth remote sensing, space exploration, and rural connectivity. {CubeSats} further provide a complementary connectivity solution to the pervasive Internet of Things ({IoT}) networks, leading to a globally connected cyber-physical system. This paper presents a holistic overview of various aspects of {CubeSat} missions and provides a thorough review of the topic from both academic and industrial perspectives. We further present recent advances in the area of {CubeSat} communications, with an emphasis on constellation-and-coverage issues, channel modeling, modulation and coding, and networking. Finally, we identify several future research directions for {CubeSat} communications, including Internet of space things, low-power long-range networks, and machine learning for {CubeSat} resource allocation.},

	abstract = {Spread spectrum, widely employed in modern digital wireless terrestrial radio systems, chooses a signal with a noise-like character and much higher bandwidth than necessary. This paper advocates spread spectrum modulation for interstellar communication, motivated by robust immunity to radio-frequency interference ({RFI}) of technological origin in the vicinity of the receiver while preserving full detection sensitivity in the presence of natural sources of noise. Receiver design for noise immunity alone provides no basis for choosing a signal with any specific character, therefore failing to reduce ambiguity. By adding {RFI} to noise immunity as a design objective, the conjunction of choice of signal (by the transmitter) together with optimum detection for noise immunity (in the receiver) leads through simple probabilistic argument to the conclusion that the signal should possess the statistical properties of a burst of white noise, and also have a large time-bandwidth product. Thus spread spectrum also provides an implicit coordination between transmitter and receiver by reducing the ambiguity as to the signal character. This strategy requires the receiver to guess the specific noise-like signal, and it is contended that this is feasible if an appropriate pseudorandom signal is generated algorithmically. For example, conceptually simple algorithms like the binary expansion of common irrational numbers like π are shown to be suitable. Due to its deliberately wider bandwidth, spread spectrum is more susceptible to dispersion and distortion in propagation through the interstellar medium, desirably reducing ambiguity in parameters like bandwidth and carrier frequency. This suggests a promising new direction in interstellar communication using spread spectrum modulation techniques.},

However, existing studies on the economic viability of asteroid mining do not provide much guidance on which technological improvements would be needed for increasing its economic viability. This paper develops a techno-economic analysis of asteroid mining with the objective of providing basic recommendations for future technology development and performance improvements. Both, providing water in space as well as returning platinum to Earth are considered. Starting from first principles of techno-economic analysis, gradually additional economic and technological factors are added to the analysis model. Applied to mining missions involving spacecraft reuse, learning curve effect, and multiple spacecraft, their economic viability is assessed. A sensitivity analysis with respect to throughput rate, spacecraft mass, and resource price is performed. Furthermore, a sample asteroid mining architecture for volatiles based on small {CubeSat}-class spacecraft is presented. It is concluded that key technological drivers for asteroid mining missions are throughput rate, number of spacecraft per mission, and the rate in which successive missions are conducted. Furthermore, for returning platinum to Earth, market reaction strongly influences its economic viability and it seems to be economically viable only under unlikely conditions.},

The paper reports on the dialouge originating from a series of workshops with participants from different backgrounds in engineering design, systems engineering, industrial design psychology and business.Definitions of innovation are revisited as used in business, management and engineering design contexts. The role of innovation is then discussed related to product development from (i) the management perspective, (ii) a systems architecture perspective and (iii) in relation to sustainable development as one driver of innovation.It is argued that engineering design has a central role in how to realise the novelty aspect of innovation and often plays a critical role in maturing these into the valuable products, and there is a need to articulate the role of engineering design in innovation to better resonate with the business and management research.},

	abstract = {The initial motivator for the development of {DRM}, a Design Research Methodology, and the subsequent writing of this book was our frustration about the lack of a common terminology, benchmarked research methods, and above all, a common research methodology in design. A shared view of the goals and framework for doing design research was missing. Design is a multidisciplinary activity occurring in multiple application areas and involving multiple stakeholders. As a consequence, design research emerges in a variety of disciplines for a variety of applications with a variety of subjects. This makes it particularly difficult to review its literature, relate various pieces of work, find common ground, and validate and share results that are so essential for sustained progress in a research community. Above all, design research needs to be successful not only in an academic sense, but also in a practical sense. How could we help the community develop knowledge that is both academically and practically worthwhile? Each of us had our individual ideas of how this situation could be improved. Lucienne Blessing, while finishing her thesis that involved studying and improving the design process, developed valuable insights about the importance and relationship of empirical studies in developing and evaluating these improvements. Amaresh Chakrabarti, while finishing his thesis on developing and evaluating computational tools for improving products, had developed valuable insights about integrating and improving the processes of building and evaluating tools.},

              has demonstrated that an 8kg 6U {CubeSat} can be designed to perform Earth observation missions equivalent to those of 50-150kg microsatellites. Their design is reviewed and its commercial potential is compared to the 156kg {RapidEye} spacecraft. Three other commercial applications of this design are described. These are: a standard spacecraft for space scientists and astronomers; the spacecraft component of an
              N
              nation 5 spectral band disaster monitoring constellation and a night imaging satellite. Nanosatellites should now be considered for commercial missions previously thought to require microsatellites.},
