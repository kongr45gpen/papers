	abstract = {Distributed space mission concepts are emerging for scientific applications requiring constellations of hundreds of thousands of satellites. Analogous to proliferating terrestrial wireless sensor networks, massively distributed sensor networks will enable the observation of real-time multi-point phenomenology. For example, an ionospheric plasma depletion sensor network would shed light on "plasma bubbles" accepted as the cause of satellite navigation and communication signal scintillation at low latitudes in the post-dusk sector. Economics dictate a low-cost, lass-producible sensor node for this prospective class of space mission. One promising concept is a satellite-on-a-printed circuit board ({PCBSat}), which leverages the multi-billion dollar infrastructure of the commercial {PCB} industry. The system configuration goals are: 10x10x2 cm and approximately 200 g mass, while supporting a small sensor, such as a Miniature Electrostatic Analyzer ({MESA}). Three interim stage prototype design cycles and partial environmental testing have been completed successfully. This paper briefly surveys distributed space missions and presents a complete mission architecture for the ionospheric plasma depletion study. Sub-kilogram very small satellite technologies are then discussed, followed by comparative cost modeling for commercial mass-production. The detailed design and environmental testing results of {PCBSat} complete the paper, including launch opportunities.},

	title = {A Model-based Methodology for Strategic Reuse of Legacy Designs in Space Mission Architecting},
	rights = {In Copyright - Educational Use Permitted},
	url = {https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/139865},
	abstract = {Design reuse is a common practice in the space industry — stemming from a desire by engineers and managers to realize cost and schedule benefits while buying down risk with proven designs. Legacy design reuse, specifically, is characterized by its opportunistic nature compared to more intentional platform-based reuse. However, legacy reuse decisions made during preliminary phases of an architecting effort are often overly optimistic regarding potential benefits. This can lead to reuse scenarios that either do not fully realize expected benefits, or result in detrimental impacts or even mission failure. 
 
This work presents a remedy in the form of the Legacy Design Reuse in {MBSE} ({LDRM}) methodology. It is a systematic approach for conducting technical and programmatic analyses for informing legacy reuse decisions in the early design phases of a mission. {LDRM} incorporates design reuse best practices and process improvements derived from a survey of industry practitioners. The resulting procedure is implemented in a Model-based Systems Engineering ({MBSE}) environment in order to leverage the integrated, authoritative, and curated data landscape of this new paradigm. Key outputs of {LDRM} are: a) assessment of reuse feasibility of a candidate design, b) enumeration of the required rework/adaptation effort, and c) estimate of the reuse scenario’s cost or schedule impacts versus a comparable from-scratch effort - using the {COSYSMO} 2.0 parametric cost modeling tool. 
 
A sample design problem demonstrates application of {LDRM} to evaluate reuse of the robotic arm design of the Curiosity rover on Luna, a hypothetical lunar rover. The Luna design case is carried into a two-phase virtual Lego design/build/reuse validation experiment. Decision-making performance of study participants with access to {LDRM} outputs is improved by close to 30\% over a control group. {LDRM} is then applied to two industry case studies. The first, reuse of the bus subsystems across the {AeroCube} 10 and {DAILI} {CubeSat} missions, demonstrates nominal procedures and outcomes for 3 of 4 subsystems explored; model incompatibilities in the attitude control system led to recommendations to the sponsor for improvements to {MBSE} model practices and curation. The second case study, exploring congressionally-mandated reuse in {NASA}’s {SLS} vehicle, finds reuse limitations in the Core Stage engine section borrowed from the Space Shuttle program. {LDRM} predicts a 43\% increase in systems engineering effort due to extensive interface rework of engine section components. These real-world findings suggest that decision support tools, like {LDRM}, can improve legacy reuse outcomes in the next generation of space systems.},

	abstract = {{CubeSats} have been developed by many different institutions since they were introduced by California Polytechnic State University and Stanford University in 1999. Given the 40\% failure rate of university missions, it is important to discover what project arrangements may give the {CubeSat} the best chance of success. The aim of this paper is to offer those wishing to start a {CubeSat} program some indications of what successful project management at a university may look like. This paper provides case studies of 3 universities who have launched more than 4 satellites: University of Michigan, the Montana State University, and Aalborg University in Denmark. The information was gathered by asking supervisors from these teams a series of questions relating to project management. These included team structure, continuity, how the students organize themselves, how much of the work is embedded in the curriculum, how new students were integrated and how documentation was used to manage the project. The different methods of organization used in the different programs were described with their unique features. After this, both the variation and the common elements were identified. It is hoped that this research will contribute to successful {CubeSat} projects in universities worldwide.},

These five themes include: flexiblity, chunkability, scalability, endurability, and teamability. These five themes further are found related to the defining principles of the agile manifesto. Using this understanding, future efforts will include empirical case study work to determine the impact that these have on application of scrum methods and tools.

	abstract = {Annotation Clean code that works--now. This is the seeming contradiction that lies behind much of the pain of programming. Test-driven development replies to this contradiction with a paradox--test the program before you write it. A new idea? Not at all. Since the dawn of computing, programmers have been specifying the inputs and outputs before programming precisely. Test-driven development takes this age-old idea, mixes it with modern languages and programming environments, and cooks up a tasty stew guaranteed to satisfy your appetite for clean code that works--now. Developers face complex programming challenges every day, yet they are not always readily prepared to determine the best solution. More often than not, such difficult projects generate a great deal of stress and bad code. To garner the strength and courage needed to surmount seemingly Herculean tasks, programmers should look to test-driven development ({TDD}), a proven set of techniques that encourage simple designs and test suites that inspire confidence. By driving development with automated tests and then eliminating duplication, any developer can write reliable, bug-free code no matter what its level of complexity. Moreover, {TDD} encourages programmers to learn quickly, communicate more clearly, and seek out constructive feedback. Readers will learn to: Solve complicated tasks, beginning with the simple and proceeding to the more complex.Write automated tests before coding.Grow a design organically by refactoring to add design decisions one at a time.Create tests for more complicated logic, including reflection and exceptions.Use patterns to decide what tests to write.Create tests using {xUnit}, the architecture at the heart of many programmer-oriented testing tools. This book follows two {TDD} projects from start to finish, illustrating techniques programmers can use to easily and dramatically increase the quality of their work. The examples are followed by references to the featured {TDD} patterns and refactorings. With its emphasis on agile methods and fast development strategies, Test-Driven Development is sure to inspire readers to embrace these under-utilized but powerful techniques. 0321146530B10172002.},

	abstract = {From 1992 until 1999, {NASA} adopted a Faster-Better-Cheaper ({FBC}) paradigm-i.e., smaller low-cost spacecraft-for its unmanned missions. When many early missions met their objectives at much lower cost than traditional flagship missions, the {FBC} approach seemed successful. However, after the failures of two Mars spacecraft in 1999, the {FBC} paradigm was viewed as a failed experiment. We reflect on the legacy of {FBC}. In particular, we focus on the organizational learning literature to explore whether {FBC}, a stretch goal, was a good step for {NASA}. Previous examinations of {FBC} have focused on failure rates rather than on cost effectiveness. We revisit the question of {FBC} by examining all unmanned {NASA} missions launched between 1974 and 2007. We find that {FBC} missions resulted in more scientific publications per dollar of mission cost than other types of missions. From our analysis, we perceive lasting benefits to current projects from the adoption of the stretch goals, and perceive that {NASA} suffers from a bias against learning from the {FBC} experiment because of the stigma of the high-profile failed projects. We conclude with the recommendation that {NASA} should challenge itself with stretch goals, but with science goals rather than human exploration goals.},

	abstract = {The initial motivator for the development of {DRM}, a Design Research Methodology, and the subsequent writing of this book was our frustration about the lack of a common terminology, benchmarked research methods, and above all, a common research methodology in design. A shared view of the goals and framework for doing design research was missing. Design is a multidisciplinary activity occurring in multiple application areas and involving multiple stakeholders. As a consequence, design research emerges in a variety of disciplines for a variety of applications with a variety of subjects. This makes it particularly difficult to review its literature, relate various pieces of work, find common ground, and validate and share results that are so essential for sustained progress in a research community. Above all, design research needs to be successful not only in an academic sense, but also in a practical sense. How could we help the community develop knowledge that is both academically and practically worthwhile? Each of us had our individual ideas of how this situation could be improved. Lucienne Blessing, while finishing her thesis that involved studying and improving the design process, developed valuable insights about the importance and relationship of empirical studies in developing and evaluating these improvements.

By taking advantage of recent technological advancements in unrelated disciplines and taking a statistical approach to mission assurance, R-selected spacecraft open the door to an entirely new paradigm in space access and exploration. This dissertation describes the challenges and advantages unique to gram-scale, R-selected spacecraft. It also presents a number of use cases --- involving distributed in-situ sensing and planetary science --- that are unique to spacecraft of the Monarch's diminutive size and large quantity. This dissertation presents a routing policy for moving information through large collections of Monarchs in low-Earth orbit, and results from simulated lunar impact survival tests. Demonstrations of distributed sensing, leaderless cooperation, routing, and actuation are presented and discussed to illustrate the viability of some entirely new mission concepts. The final chapters anticipate future capabilities for Monarchs and present a method for extracting insights from the sorts of datasets which swarms of Monarchs will produce. The appendices discuss applications for distributed in-situ sensing in digital agriculture, and present datasets gathered by the Monarchs from vineyards and dairy calves.},

Throughout this paper, we walk through what Spire has undertaken to get a commercial satellite constellation up and running. To enable both scale and rapid technology iteration, the design processes and systems have evolved to be lean but reliable. An iterative systems engineering approach ensures the necessary control, speed and reliability as features are added to the constellation. Solid process control and an experienced manufacturing team ensure reliable, repeatable and rapid satellite Assembly, Integration and Testing ({AIT}). A global groundstation network provides full control in accessing the satellite data. Complex software systems are in place to orchestrate the space and ground assets, to extract maximum customer value and provide the mission flexibility that’s needed in rapidly changing market environments. An efficient satellite operations team monitors and responds to the changing behaviors of the constellation. All of these factors together comprise a system that can be leveraged to enable other businesses to be successful as well without having to build and maintain all this infrastructure, as the importance of the space-as-a-service concept grows.},

	abstract = {Since the advent of {CubeSat} spacecraft, universities and private entities have been successfully designing and launching satellites at a fraction of the traditional cost. These satellites still accommodate useful scientific payloads. Another recently established satellite format is the {PocketQube} ({PQ})-one eighth the size of a {CubeSat} – with the aim of further reducing launching costs. However, this brings with it the challenge of working with substantially smaller power, mass and volume budgets. Accurate ionospheric modelling requires the use of electron density measurements at the topside of the ionosphere which could be obtained via distributed in-situ sensing. This makes a low cost {PQ} constellation ideal for this application. In order to assess the feasibility of the {PQ} format, a preliminary study was conducted about the design of a {PQ} technology demonstrator capable of carrying a scientific payload. In this paper, the design approaches are discussed, keeping in mind the design budget restrictions as well as the constraints imposed by the ionospheric sensor.},

Criticism of requirements engineering ({RE}) practices current in {CSDOs} is prominent among the motivations spurring this movement. Comparison of high level features of {ADMs} with established systems engineering ({SE}) approaches reveals that there is significant commonality between them. The most important difference relates to the mixing in of development activities with high level {RE} activities, involving developers in them from the outset and reducing formality. On the basis of this analysis we make some general observations on the value of {ADMs} and their advocacy.},

When a local task is completed, its output is integrated through an iterative cycle of system-wide integration activities. Integration is often accompanied by inadvertent information hiding due to the asynchronous information exchanges. We show that information hiding leads to persistent recurrence of problems (termed the design churn effect) such that progress oscillates between being on schedule and falling behind. The oscillatory nature of the {PD} process confounds progress measurement and makes it difficult to judge whether the project is on schedule or slipping. We develop a dynamic model of work transformation to derive conditions under which churn is observed as an unintended consequence of information hiding due to local and system task decomposition. We illustrate these conditions with a case example from an automotive development project and discuss strategies to mitigate design churn.},

However, these teams often lack the infrastructure and resources for having effective systems engineering or project management which are beneficial for addressing these challenges and developing complex systems, such as satellites. In this paper we present the results of an exploratory case study of a university {CubeSat} team developing an Earth Observation satellite. The Agile Decision Guidance method was applied to pinpoint parts of the project organization that could benefit from agile methods in three specific areas: customer problem space, solution space, and product development space. The results drew attention to areas such as; stakeholder management, knowledge and information management, and the support environment, that could benefit from an agile approach. We outline some of the plans to move forward and how the team responded to the analysis. We also discuss if the method was appropriate for academic small satellite organizations and adaptations of the method made during the assessment.},

Equipped with a Raspberry Pi, a small commercially available computer, the {EECSat} has the potential to conduct onboard computations in space for a fraction of the cost compared to other large-scale satellites making the {EECSat} unique. Additionally, the {EECSat} is being developed to be a bus driven design. The bus driven design, another unique attribute of the {EECSat}, will serve as the constraints and requirements for future payloads in order to pioneer a standardized satellite platform. The {EECSat} project focused extensively on stakeholder analysis, research, problem definition, requirement generation, interdisciplinary collaboration, and documentation of the novel idea called {EECSat}.},

The satellite tested for these reported efforts was the {MOVE}-{II} {CubeSat}, developed at the Technical University of Munich since April 2015. The {HIL} environment has supported the development and verification of {MOVE}-{II}’s flight software and continues to aid the {MOVE}-{II} mission after its launch on 3 December 2018. The {HIL} environment allows the satellite to interact with a simulated space environment in real-time during on-ground tests. Simulated models are used to replace the satellite’s sensors and actuators, providing the interaction between the satellite and the {HIL} simulation. This approach allows for high hardware coverage and requires relatively low development effort and equipment cost compared to other simulation approaches. One key distinction from other simulation environments is the inclusion of the electrical domain of the satellite, which enables accurate power budget verification. The presented results include the verification of {MOVE}-{II}’s attitude determination and control algorithms, the verification of the power budget, and the training of the operator team with realistic simulated failures prior to launch. This report additionally presents how the simulation environment was used to analyze issues detected after launch and to verify the performance of new software developed to address the in-flight anomalies prior to software deployment.},

Meanwhile, the copper coils embedded in the boards can form a 3D magnetorquer when the {PCBSat} is at the orthogonal-fold status, making magnetic de-tumbling possible.

This paper introduces Stardust, a cluster of femto-satellites, to exploit their capacity of distributed measurement in the space. The design of Stardust consists of subsystems, space self-organized networking and thermal control. After the satellites were launched into the low earth orbit, experiments were carried out to verify the distributed measurement performance including multi-point wireless networking and measurement of the geomagnetic field. Results show that Stardust can work properly and effectively in a long period, which is proved to be a good reference for future femto-satellite design and space distributed measurement systems.},

One compelling area of current space research is the design of miniaturized satellites, known as {CubeSats}, which are enticing because of their numerous applications and low design-and-deployment cost. The new paradigm of connected space through {CubeSats} makes possible a wide range of applications, such as Earth remote sensing, space exploration, and rural connectivity. {CubeSats} further provide a complementary connectivity solution to the pervasive Internet of Things ({IoT}) networks, leading to a globally connected cyber-physical system. This paper presents a holistic overview of various aspects of {CubeSat} missions and provides a thorough review of the topic from both academic and industrial perspectives. We further present recent advances in the area of {CubeSat} communications, with an emphasis on constellation-and-coverage issues, channel modeling, modulation and coding, and networking. Finally, we identify several future research directions for {CubeSat} communications, including Internet of space things, low-power long-range networks, and machine learning for {CubeSat} resource allocation.},

	shorttitle = {Interstellar communication},
	abstract = {Spread spectrum, widely employed in modern digital wireless terrestrial radio systems, chooses a signal with a noise-like character and much higher bandwidth than necessary. This paper advocates spread spectrum modulation for interstellar communication, motivated by robust immunity to radio-frequency interference ({RFI}) of technological origin in the vicinity of the receiver while preserving full detection sensitivity in the presence of natural sources of noise. Receiver design for noise immunity alone provides no basis for choosing a signal with any specific character, therefore failing to reduce ambiguity. By adding {RFI} to noise immunity as a design objective, the conjunction of choice of signal (by the transmitter) together with optimum detection for noise immunity (in the receiver) leads through simple probabilistic argument to the conclusion that the signal should possess the statistical properties of a burst of white noise, and also have a large time-bandwidth product. Thus spread spectrum also provides an implicit coordination between transmitter and receiver by reducing the ambiguity as to the signal character. This strategy requires the receiver to guess the specific noise-like signal, and it is contended that this is feasible if an appropriate pseudorandom signal is generated algorithmically. For example, conceptually simple algorithms like the binary expansion of common irrational numbers like π are shown to be suitable. Due to its deliberately wider bandwidth, spread spectrum is more susceptible to dispersion and distortion in propagation through the interstellar medium, desirably reducing ambiguity in parameters like bandwidth and carrier frequency. This suggests a promising new direction in interstellar communication using spread spectrum modulation techniques.},

	abstract = {This research conducts a broad systems-based analysis of {CubeSat} engineering, with a focus on testing, failures, and their relationship to program cost, in order to assess multiple build approaches with a goal of maintaining the advantages of {CubeSat} missions while increasing reliability. In this work, the multiple approaches are called "beta build strategies," and we show that satellite engineering groups with minimal experience can increase their probability of success by building two flight-model versions of their satellite, allowing for more exhaustive and potentially failure-inducing testing to be conducted on the first (beta version) satellite. This differentiates itself from the standard {CubeSat} build approach, which is typically to build a flat sat, then an engineering model, and then a flight model of the satellite. Frequently with {CubeSat} development, the additional expense of building a flight-like engineering model is avoided. However, in this work we consider the probability of success and overall cost impact for multiple approaches toward the flight build. We find that by spending an additional 33\% of the planned program cost, a team which plans to take this alternate approach from the beginning can build and launch two flight-model versions of their spacecraft, increasing probability of success by 30\%. This cost corresponds to a 40\% saving from the scenario in which the decision to build a second flight-model spacecraft is made only after the first fails. The question which this analysis tries to answer is not, "how does a group spend the least amount of money to get their first {CubeSat} into space?" but rather, "how does a group spend the least amount of money to get a {CubeSat} into space that works?"},

	title = {{OSIRIS}4CubeSat - System Engineering with new Space approach from the development of a high data-rate optical communication payload to the demonstrator in a quasi-operational mission},
	url = {https://elib.dlr.de/136602/},
	abstract = {Modern satellite missions like {CubeSat}-missions are characterized by extremely short development time and significant low resource requirements. This can only be reached by reducing classical standards to necessary levels, tailored down for the respective mission. It leads to a rethinking of system engineering in modern space missions following the new space approach, which tailors down the standard processes to a minimum but reasonable level. 
The Optical Communication Systems Group ({OCS}) of {DLR} develops solutions to break the bottleneck caused by limited data-rates of traditional {RF}-communication systems with Free-Space-Optics ({FSO}) technologies for earth orbiting platforms. Therefore {DLR} started 10 years ago the {OSIRIS} (Optical Space {InfraRed} {downlInk} System) program which concentrates on research and development of laser communication terminals for Low-Earth-Orbit ({LEO}) satellites. The development speed in laser communication accelerated in the last years due to the availability of compact and low-cost flying platforms like pico- and nanosatellites. Therefore {OCS} follows the new space approach to shorten development times and finish projects much earlier compared to traditional space missions.
The {OSIRIS}4CubeSat (O4C) project has the goal to develop a high data-rate optical communication payload for {CubeSats} and demonstrates it in a quasi-operational scenario. The development of the payload is in close collaboration with Tesat-Spacecom who sells O4C under the name '{CubeLCT}' as a commercial product. Beside the payload development, the functionality of O4C will be demonstrated in a direct to earth downlink from a {CubeSat} to an Optical Ground Station. Thus, the payload will fly in the {PIXL}-1 mission on a 3U {CubeSat} built by {GomSpace}. After the Launch and Early Operational Phase ({LEOP}) the satellite will be hand over to German Space Operation Center ({GSOC}) to demonstrate for the first a time a commanding of a {CubeSat} by a professional Ground System. 
The ambitious path from the development of the payload, which started from scratch, to a quasi-operational mission, shows the necessity of a working system engineering to observe all requirements, coordinate the different teams and manage the interfaces to the stakeholder. This paper describes the system engineering based on the new space approach for a modern {CubeSat} mission. In the beginning of the project the overall requirements for the whole project were defined. This includes the technical requirements for the payload, to ensure the functionality depending on the extreme environmental conditions in space and the requirements for the satellite. Furthermore the operational requirements were defined. Additionally to the internal requirements the needs of the commercialization partner and the possible launch opportunities had to be considered.
Beside the requirements, the single work packages were defined to distinguish the several tasks and visualise the interfaces and connections in a work breakdown structure ({WBS}). Based on the {WBS} the technical teams for the development were formed. During the concept development and the integration of the payload, the system engineering had to monitor the requirements and coordinate the different technical teams with all their interfaces. Even though the teams were separated in optics, mechanics, electronics and software, their tasks were strongly connected. Beside the internal interface coordination the system engineering had to coordinate the communication on technical level to the external stakeholders like contractee (Tesat), satellite manufacturer ({GomSpace}), launch provider and operator ({GSOC}). 
This paper gives an overview over the processes in the {OSIRIS}4CubeSat project which represents modern system engineering following the new space approach.},

	title = {Special Characteristics of Concurrent Engineering Studies dealing with Cubesat missions and their impact on the {CE} process},
	url = {https://elib.dlr.de/105553/},
	abstract = {The continuously growing commercial and scientific relevance of nanosatellite missions, especially Cubesats, is clearly discernible in the space community. Due to this, it is important to analyse the special characteristics and demands of early phase studies for such missions to consider them in the Concurrent Engineering Facility ({CEF}), {DLR} Bremen’s system analysis laboratory. Within such studies, various differences have been observed which make it necessary to adapt the established {CE} process for study preparation, conduction and post-processing to meet the specific demands of these well-constrained systems, and thereby create the optimal study results together with the design team.
On the design level, the major differences can mainly be traced to two closely connected peculiarities of {CubeSat} design. First, the targeted system is strictly limited in size, mass and form factor by the associated standard. Because of this, and the growing acceptance of Cubesats, a wide set of highly integrated {COTS} components and complete subsystems exists on the market with detailed datasheets, and even 3D models freely available on the internet. Secondly, this pool of applicable hardware increases the level of detail the study team has to deal with in a {CE} study, sometimes even down to connector and harness layout.
In a nutshell, the process of {CE} studies has to be adapted for these small systems towards a later-phase like level of detail, while preserving the creative and efficient way of solution finding traditionally associated with the {CE} process, including known benefits such as time and cost savings, and design quality improvement. Based on conducted {CE} studies for {CubeSat} missions, this paper points to some of the most noticeable and important lessons learnt and derives suggestions for possible process adaptations.
One of a {CE} study’s team leader’s main tasks is to make sure the design process is followed in the most efficient way possible. However, different activities or designs require at times a different approach and ad hoc modifications to the traditional {CE} process. Starting with the findings from the Cubesat experience, it becomes more and more obvious that the proven process and work approach has to be adapted not only depending on the type of activity conducted in the {CEF} but also on the design team’s background and composition. To exemplify this, the differences for “regular” and {CubeSat} studies, plus less strictly defined moderated workshops, are analysed in this paper with a special focus on the most promising particular respective communication and guidance styles of the team leaders, as experienced in the {CEF}.},

	shorttitle = {Centimeter-Scale Spacecraft},
	abstract = {The rise of the consumer electronics industry has led to a profusion of ever smaller, cheaper, and more capable devices, from sensors to computers to radios. Many of these components are suitable for use in spacecraft. Their availability has led to the ongoing revolution in small satellites, most visibly exemplified by the {CubeSat} standard. This study seeks to push these trends toward their ultimate extreme: a satellite-on-a-chip. The ability to mass produce small, cheap, essentially disposable spacecraft has many implications for space exploration, Earth and atmospheric science, and education. New missions to characterize planetary surfaces and atmospheres, asteroids, and Earth's ionosphere could be planned using thousands of tiny spacecraft equipped with a variety of sensors. Such mission architectures would allow thousands of data points to be captured simultaneously across vast distances, offering unprecedented spatial resolution. Additionally, the cost of launching a satellite will be within reach for high schools, student groups, and even individual hobbyists, making space accessible to the general public in new ways. This dissertation documents the development of the Sprite centimeter-scale spacecraft, along with the associated hardware and software necessary for its deployment in low-Earth orbit and communication with ground stations. In addition, new solutions to several general spacecraft dynamics, control, and estimation problems with relevance to small and low-cost spacecraft are presented. These include  control laws for flat-spin recovery and spin inversion, an algorithm for on-orbit inertia estimation, and variational integrators for spacecraft attitude dynamics that offer improved performance over traditional Runge-Kutta schemes in spacecraft guidance, navigation, and control applications.},

	abstract = {We present the preliminary results of our investigation on the effectiveness of the Serum methodology for Agile development of space hardware. We analyze the development process of a hardware payload that is part of a host nanosatellite mission composed of two 6U {CubeSats} (30cm × 20cm × 10cm). The host mission is a collaboration with several partners including academia and small and medium enterprises. Scrum is a product development process created as a faster, more effective way of developing software. The goal of our investigation is to understand whether and by how much the same Scrum principles that proved successful in software can be adopted vis-à-vis in hardware projects. We also intend to identify the fundamental challenges in such an approach for space missions. In the host mission, Scrum has been adopted for the development of the payload subject to the investigation. The paper introduces the ongoing development process and identifies Scrum-related challenges internal to the payload development and challenges related to the coordination of the process with partners adopting established development processes. The paper identifies opportunities of future work for the fine tuning of Agile development methodologies in space projects and illustrates key statistics that have been collected throughout the development so far.},

	abstract = {{CubeSats} are widely used by universities and research institutions all over the world. Their popularity is generally attributed to the use of low-cost components, free student labor and simple design. They have been shown to encourage Science, Technology, Engineering and Math ({STEM}) students to become involved in designing, implementing and testing a real functioning spacecraft system. Projects like this encourage students from different disciplines to team up to design and build {CubeSats}, providing interdisciplinary work experience. Participating students vary in their expertise in developing such systems. Some will work on the project for years while others are not willing to spend two or three consecutive semesters developing a {CubeSat} project. Despite their simplicity in design and low cost, {CubeSats} are considered great engineering systems for exploring space. Nevertheless, a large number of {CubeSat} projects fail due to having an unclear mission, ambiguous system requirements and a lack of documentation. Students need to have a clear vision of how to build a real {CubeSat} system that can be launched and that can function in space. Thus, this paper proposes engineering methodologies and tools to help students develop {CubeSat} systems. These tools can help students with planning, collecting, eliciting and documenting the requirements in a well-defined manner. This paper focuses on student-driven {CubeSat} projects designed by students and faculty members. Additionally, data is presented in this paper to identify the challenges and needs of {CubeSat} developers. Plans for future work are also discussed.},

	abstract = {With an increase in the use of small, modular, resource-limited satellites for Earth orbiting applications, the benefit to be had from a model-based architecture that rapidly searches the mission trade-space and identifies near-optimal designs is greater than ever. This work presents an architecture that identifies trends between conflicting objectives (e.g. lifecycle cost and performance) and decision variables (e.g. orbit altitude and inclination) such that informed assessment can be made as to which design/s to take on for further analysis. The models within the architecture exploit analytic methods where possible, in order avoid computationally expensive numerical propagation, and achieve rapid convergence. Two mission cases are studied; the first is an Earth observation satellite and presents a trade-off between ground sample distance and revisit time over a ground target, given altitude as the decision variable. The second is a satellite with a generic scientific payload and shows a more involved trade-off, between data return to a ground station and cost of the mission, given variations in the orbit altitude, inclination and ground station latitude. Results of each case are presented graphically and it is clear that non-intuitive results are captured that would typically be missed using traditional, point-design methods, where only discrete scenarios are examined.},

	abstract = {High safety and performance requirements drive the mission criticality of space exploration systems. There is often only one chance for mission success, and failure can be fatal. Although proximate causes of failure are often technical, root causes are usually mismanagement of the social context, leading to human error. Thus, while needing to maintain safety standards and faced with budgetary cuts and industry globalization, the space industry is driven to consider alternate methodologies by which to achieve success and limit failure. While Agile practices produce much interest within all aspects of mission-critical systems engineering, there is not much supporting data with respect to specific applicability of practices within the space industry. The need to review space-based systems engineering methodologies and to contemplate the applicability of disparate software engineering techniques, such as Agile, motivates the following research objective: The goal of this research is to identify which Agile practices, if any, are desirable and suitable for space-based systems engineering. Although some Agile practices may be discarded outright, others seem quite useful and should be given consideration. Scrum and extreme Programming ({XP}) show particular potential as does practicing hybrid approaches that combine Agile practices with existing formal methodologies and engineering standards.},

Throughout, Dr. Douglass couples agile methods with {SysML} and {MBSE} to arm system engineers with the conceptual and methodological tools they need to avoid specification defects and improve system quality while simultaneously reducing the effort and cost of systems engineering. Identifies how the concepts and techniques of agile methods can be effectively applied in systems engineering context Shows how to perform model-based functional analysis and tie these analyses back to system requirements and stakeholder needs, and forward to system architecture and interface definition Provides a means by which the quality and correctness of systems engineering data can be assured (before the entire system is built!)

	abstract = {In the last decades, agile methods had a huge impact on how software is developed. In many cases, this has led to significant benefits, such as quality and speed of software deliveries to customers. However, safety-critical systems have widely been dismissed from benefiting from agile methods. Products that include safety critical aspects are therefore faced with a situation in which the development of safety-critical parts can significantly limit the potential speed-up through agile methods, for the full product, but also in the non-safety critical parts. For such products, the ability to develop safety-critical software in an agile way will generate a competitive advantage. In order to enable future research in this important area, we present in this paper a mapping of the current state of practice based on a mixed method approach. Starting from a workshop with experts from six large Swedish product development companies we develop a lens for our analysis. We then present a systematic mapping study on safety-critical systems and agile development through this lens in order to map potential benefits, challenges, and solution candidates for guiding future research.},

	abstract = {The miniaturization of electronic and mechanical components has allowed for an unprecedented downscaling of spacecraft size and mass. Today, spacecraft with a mass between 1 to 10 grams, {AttoSats}, have been developed and operated in space. Due to their small size, they introduce a new paradigm in spacecraft design, relying on agile development, rapid iterations, and massive redundancy. However, no systematic survey of the potential advantages and unique mission concepts based on {AttoSats} exists. This paper explores the potential of {AttoSats} for future space missions. First, we present the state of the art of {AttoSats}. Next, we identify unique {AttoSat} characteristics and map them to future mission capabilities. Finally, we go beyond {AttoSats} and explore how smart dust and nano-scale spacecraft could allow for even smaller spacecraft in the milligram range: zepto- and yocto spacecraft.},

	abstract = {We developed Scrum in the early 1990s. We wrote the first version of the Scrum Guide in 2010 to help
people worldwide understand Scrum. We have evolved the Guide since then through small, functional
updates. Together, we stand behind it.
The Scrum Guide contains the definition of Scrum. Each element of the framework serves a specific
purpose that is essential to the overall value and results realized with Scrum. Changing the core design
or ideas of Scrum, leaving out elements, or not following the rules of Scrum, covers up problems and
limits the benefits of Scrum, potentially even rendering it useless.
We follow the growing use of Scrum within an ever-growing complex world. We are humbled to see
Scrum being adopted in many domains holding essentially complex work, beyond software product
development where Scrum has its roots. As Scrum’s use spreads, developers, researchers, analysts,
scientists, and other specialists do the work. We use the word “developers” in Scrum not to exclude,
but to simplify. If you get value from Scrum, consider yourself included.
As Scrum is being used, patterns, processes, and insights that fit the Scrum framework as described in
this document, may be found, applied and devised. Their description is beyond the purpose of the
Scrum Guide because they are context sensitive and differ widely between Scrum uses. Such tactics for
using within the Scrum framework vary widely and are described elsewhere},

	abstract = {Continuous practices, i.e., continuous integration, delivery, and deployment, are the software development industry practices that enable organizations to frequently and reliably release new features and products. With the increasing interest in the literature on continuous practices, it is important to systematically review and synthesize the approaches, tools, challenges, and practices reported for adopting and implementing continuous practices. This paper aimed at systematically reviewing the state of the art of continuous practices to classify approaches and tools, identify challenges and practices in this regard, and identify the gaps for future research. We used the systematic literature review method for reviewing the peer-reviewed papers on continuous practices published between 2004 and June 1, 2016. We applied the thematic analysis method for analyzing the data extracted from reviewing 69 papers selected using predefined criteria. We have identified 30 approaches and associated tools, which facilitate the implementation of continuous practices in the following ways: (1) reducing build and test time in continuous integration ({CI}); (2) increasing visibility and awareness on build and test results in {CI}; (3) supporting (semi-) automated continuous testing; (4) detecting violations, flaws, and faults in {CI}; (5) addressing security and scalability issues in deployment pipeline; and (6) improving dependability and reliability of deployment process. We have also determined a list of critical factors, such as testing (effort and time), team awareness and transparency, good design principles, customer, highly skilled and motivated team, application domain, and appropriate infrastructure that should be carefully considered when introducing continuous practices in a given organization. The majority of the reviewed papers were validation (34.7\%) and evaluation (36.2\%) research types. This paper also reveals that continuous practices have been successfully applied to both greenfield and maintenance projects. Continuous practices have become an important area of software engineering research and practice. While the reported approaches, tools, and practices are addressing a wide range of challenges, there are several challenges and gaps, which require future research work for improving the capturing and reporting of contextual information in the studies reporting different aspects of continuous practices; gaining a deep understanding of how software-intensive systems should be (re-) architected to support continuous practices; and addressing the lack of knowledge and tools for engineering processes of designing and running secure deployment pipelines.},

	abstract = {Hardware-in-the-loop test beds are applied in industrial satellite development to verify on-board software and to simulate operational scenarios. Spacecraft attitude sensors are simulated by models, which eliminate the need to stimulate them for closed loop scenarios. Similarly, attitude actuators are simulated including actuation interaction with spacecraft dynamics behavior. This approach leads to an enormous reduction in a spacecraft's verification time. Small satellites developed by organizations like {AMSAT} or by universities are even more limited with respect to available staff and thus even more constrained. As a consequence, there is a need to implement a comparable approach for a hardware-in-the-loop simulation environment at lower cost than in industrial development. The University of Stuttgart has developed and verified a hardware-in-the-loop system test bed for a small satellite's on-board computer while maintaining compliance to industrial standards. Further cost reduction was achieved by applying an industrial system simulation kernel, additional open-source software, the voluntary participation of students, and cooperation with the industry. The system simulation environment connected to the on-board computer was verified by comparing its results with dedicated simulation tools of several disciplines. The latency of signal transfers between the on-board software and the simulator in closed loop operation was determined and analyzed with respect to compliance to control loops and simulation step sizes. All results have been proven to be satisfactory for application in university satellite development and are presented in this publication. This setup is now used in the frame of the on-board software verification for the Flying Laptop satellite.},

	abstract = {A new class of distributed space missions is emerging which requires hundreds to thousands of satellites for real-time, distributed, multi-point sensing to accomplish long-awaited remote sensing and science objectives. These missions, stymied by the lack of a low-cost mass-producible solution, can become reality by merging the concepts of distributed satellite systems and terrestrial wireless sensor networks. However, unlike terrestrial sensor nodes, space-based nodes must survive unique environmental hazards while undergoing complex orbital dynamics. A novel sub-kilogram very small satellite design is needed to meet these requirements. Sub-kilogram satellite concepts are developing elsewhere, such as traditional picosatellites and microengineered aerospace systems. Although viable technical solutions, these technologies currently come at a high cost due to their reliance on high-density technology or custom manufacturing processes. While evaluating these technologies, two untapped technology areas became evident that uniquely encompass low cost and mass producibility by leveraging existing commercial production techniques: satellite-on-a-chip ({SpaceChip}) and satellite-on-a-printed circuit board ({PCBSat}). This paper focuses on the design, build, and test results of a prototype {PCBSat} with a prototype unit cost less than \$300. The paper concludes with mission applications and future direction.},

	abstract = {Both startups and traditional space industry are exploring new business opportunities and new engineering approaches in what is becoming known now as New Space. Organizations started accelerating project schedules and challenging the V-model typically used in space product development. The need of a faster and more adaptive response to changing customer needs within an improved development productivity made Agile process a potential key enabler of New Space sector. On the other hand, space system projects are typically executed in multi-party consortia. Each organization in a consortium adopts its own product development process and interprets “New Space” differently. For this reason, the implementation of Agile is not seamless as it requires coordination with traditional systems engineering approaches. This setup is what we refer to as “hybrid Agile product development process”. This paper provides a first definition of the architecture of hybrid product development process targeted toward systems development and lifecycle management of hardware projects developed by multi-party consortia. We consider this discussion in the context of the development of spaceflight hardware in the New Space industry. We identify the main challenges in adopting such a methodology in developing hardware systems. This work identifies opportunities of future work for defining coordination approaches in hybrid product development settings, and improved organization structures of hardware projects in hybrid development contexts.},

This paper discloses the adaptation and application of concepts developed in agile software engineering to hardware product and system development for critical military applications. This challenging spacecraft did not use existing key technology (heritage hardware) and created a large paradigm shift from traditional spacecraft development. The insertion of new technologies and methods in space hardware has long been a problem due to long build times, the desire to use heritage hardware, and lack of effective process. The role of momentum in the innovative process can be exploited to tackle ongoing technology disruptions and allowing risk interactions to be mitigated in a disciplined manner. Examples of how these concepts were used during the {MBD} program will be delineated. Maintaining project momentum was essential to assess the constant non recurring technological challenges which needed to be retired rapidly from the engineering risk liens. Development never slowed due to tactical assessment of the hardware with the adoption of the {SCRUM} technique. We adapted this concept as a representation of mitigation of technical risk while allowing for design freeze later in the program's development cycle. By using Agile Systems Engineering and Management techniques which enabled decisive action, the product development momentum effectively was used to produce two novel space vehicles in a fraction of time with dramatically reduced cost.},

	abstract = {Design information of a spacecraft is collected over all phases in the lifecycle of a project. A lot of this information is exchanged between different engineering tasks and business processes. In some lifecycle phases, model-based system engineering ({MBSE}) has introduced system models and databases that help to organize such information and to keep it consistent for everyone. Nevertheless, none of the existing databases approached the whole lifecycle yet. Virtual Satellite is the {MBSE} database developed at {DLR}. It has been used for quite some time in Phase A studies and is currently extended for implementing it in the whole lifecycle of spacecraft projects. Since it is unforeseeable which future use cases such a database needs to support in all these different projects, the underlying data model has to provide tailoring and extension mechanisms to its conceptual data model ({CDM}). This paper explains the mechanisms as they are implemented in Virtual Satellite, which enables extending the {CDM} along the project without corrupting already stored information. As an upcoming major use case, Virtual Satellite will be implemented as {MBSE} tool in the S2TEP project. This project provides a new satellite bus for internal research and several different payload missions in the future. This paper explains how Virtual Satellite will be used to manage configuration control problems associated with such a multi-mission platform. It discusses how the S2TEP project starts using the software for collecting the first design information from concurrent engineering studies, then making use of the extension mechanisms of the {CDM} to introduce further information artefacts such as functional electrical architecture, thus linking more and more processes into an integrated {MBSE} approach.},

A current research debate is regarding whether safety-critical systems are better developed with traditional waterfall processes or agile processes that are purportedly faster and promise to lead to better products. Objective To identify the issues and disputes in agile development of safety-critical software and the key qualities as found in the extant research literature. Method We conducted a systematic literature review as an interpretive study following a research design to search, assess, extract, group, and understand the results of the found studies. Results There are key issues and propositions that we elicit from the literature and combine into a conceptual model for understanding the foundational challenges of agile software development of safety-critical systems. The conceptual model consists of four problematic practice areas and five relationships, which we find to be even more important than the problematic areas. From this review, we suggest that there are important research gaps that need to be investigated. Conclusions We suggest that future research should have a primary focus on the relationships in the resulting conceptual model and specifically on the dynamics of the field as a whole, on incremental versus iterative development, and on how to create value with minimal but sufficient effort.},

              Recent work by Tsitas and Kingston
              (1)
              has demonstrated that an 8kg 6U {CubeSat} can be designed to perform Earth observation missions equivalent to those of 50-150kg microsatellites. Their design is reviewed and its commercial potential is compared to the 156kg {RapidEye} spacecraft. Three other commercial applications of this design are described. These are: a standard spacecraft for space scientists and astronomers; the spacecraft component of an
              N
              nation 5 spectral band disaster monitoring constellation and a night imaging satellite. Nanosatellites should now be considered for commercial missions previously thought to require microsatellites.},

The need of spatial services has been a significant growth due to several factors such as population increases, telecommunication applications, climate changes, earth control and observation military goals, and so on. To cover this, spatial vehicle generations, specific calculators and Femto-cell systems have been developed. More recently, Ultra - Small Satellites ({USS}) have been proposed and different approaches, concerning developing of these kind of spatial systems, have been presented in literature. This miniature satellite is capable to fly in the space and to provide different services such as imagery, measures and communications [4, 9, 10]. This paper deals with the study of two different {USS} Femto-satellite architectures that exist in literature in order to propose a future architecture that can provide an optimization of power supply consumption and ameliorate service communication quality.},

Low costs, lack of strict technical requirements and scarcity of publicly available documentation often drive up the risks for educational, scientific and commercial {CubeSats}. This thesis investigates a configurable and modular Fault Detection, Isolation and Recovery ({FDIR}) architecture that uses the {ECSS} Packet Utilisation Standard. This {FDIR} concept, along with the provided open-source software implementation, can be used by {CubeSat} missions to increase the reliability of their design and chances of mission success, by autonomously responding to on-board errors. The thesis also includes background information regarding {CubeSat} reliability, and explores the software and hardware used to implement the proposed {FDIR} design on the {AcubeSAT} mission, currently under design by students of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki.},

	abstract = {Electric Double-Layer Capacitors ({EDLC}), also known as supercapacitors or ultracapacitors, are being considered as an energy storage option in space applications because they can operate over wider temperature ranges, and have longer lifetimes and higher power densities than batteries. However, the limited number of studies concerned with the suitability of Commercial-off-the-shelf ({COTS}) supercapacitors to withstand the launch and space environment has hindered the practical use of supercapacitors on-board satellites. To contribute to studies that support the feasibility of using supercapacitors in small spacecraft, two goals are pursued: First, to demonstrate that a supercapacitor can survive the launch. Second, to prove that charging and discharging a supercapacitor in Low Earth Orbit ({LEO}) is possible. Three charge-discharge cycles of the supercapacitor in {LEO} have been recorded over the time-span of five months from the launch, and are compared to ground results. In addition, self-discharge over two days in orbit has been calculated as less than 2.5\%. These results show that the {COTS} supercapacitor can withstand the launch and space environment with capacitance loss lower than 1\% and, therefore, is a viable energy storage device for {LEO} satellites. However, degradation of the supercapacitor over longer stays in orbit and repeated cycling is yet to be characterised.},

The long-term preservation of raw data of astroparticle experiments as originally generated is essential for re-running analyses and reproducing research results. The selected high-quality raw data should have detailed documentation and accompanied by open software tools for access to them. We consider applicability of binary file format description languages to specify, parse and verify raw data of the Tunka Advanced Instrument for cosmic rays and Gamma Astronomy ({TAIGA}) experiment. The formal specifications are implemented for five data formats of the experiment and provide automatic generation of source code for data reading libraries in target programming languages (e.g. C++, Java, and Python). These libraries were tested on {TAIGA} data. They showed a good performance and help us to locate the parts with corrupted data. The format specifications can be used as metadata for exchanging of astroparticle raw data. They can also simplify software development for data aggregation from various sources for the multi-messenger analysis.},

This paper puts the concept of method in the context of related concepts and proposes a multi-level model of the elements of a method to argue that a contribution on each of these levels can be of value and that the introduction of methods can fail on each of these levels. Implications thereof for industry and academia are discussed, concluding that a clear description of methods and their intended use is important for enabling proper validation of each of the method’s elements and for communicating methods to academia and industry.},

Viewing this shift as a natural experiment in which some workers were already working remotely before the pandemic enables us to separate the effects of firm-wide remote work from other pandemic-related confounding factors. Here, we use rich data on the emails, calendars, instant messages, video/audio calls and workweek hours of 61,182 {US} Microsoft employees over the first six months of 2020 to estimate the causal effects of firm-wide remote work on collaboration and communication. Our results show that firm-wide remote work caused the collaboration network of workers to become more static and siloed, with fewer bridges between disparate parts. Furthermore, there was a decrease in synchronous communication and an increase in asynchronous communication. Together, these effects may make it harder for employees to acquire and share new information across the network.},

The development of the satellite started as a student project in 2006. First-{MOVE} was launched on November 21st 2013. The student-designed and built satellite was operated for almost a month. On December 19th 2013 a major malfunction occurred, presumably due to an anomaly in the on-board data handling system ({OBDH}), which left the satellite in a mode where it is only transmitting continuous wave ({CW}) beacons. Although the short mission duration prevented several mission objectives from being achieved, the overall program can be considered a success, as it permitted more than 70 students hands-on experience and led to major in-house technology and spaceflight processing developments. The main aspects of a university-led satellite development, the results of the mission and both technical as well as educational lessons learned are described, including the management and planning of student projects as well as motivational and system engineering aspects. These aspects include planning the project around student's schedules rather than in a traditional, linear fashion, the careful selection and distribution of team members to subsystem teams and the deviation from traditional systems engineering process flows in order to retain student motivation. The importance of large milestone reviews and kick-off events as short term goals and as a means to recruit new team members are highlighted. Academic outreach programs included a one week summer school held in 2011 to recruit and train new students in a time-efficient setting in relevant technical aspects. The paper explains in more detail the technical lessons learned from the major satellite subsystems, both self-developed and purchased. The self-developed systems include, among others, the design of the solar-panel release mechanism, the unique {CMOS} latch-up protection system, the hard-command unit and the {OBDH} system. Although we can report a flawless function of all the purchased subsystems in-orbit, the detailed in-house system-level testing of these components is a major lessons learned of First-{MOVE} from the prospective of student education and system knowledge. Despite the existence of documentation, the time and knowledge needed for designing a test bed for the electric power system ({EPS}) and the subsequent testing was underestimated. Furthermore, from a testing prospective, the importance of integrated system-level testing and the need for longer, continuous operations test of the satellite are emphasized. On-orbit flight data, as well as educational lessons learned for efficient student involvement during mission operations are highlighted. An outlook to {MOVE} {II}, the follow-up satellite project of {LRT}, outlines how the lessons learned of the last generation students can be carried over and how they will influence future (student) satellite developments and spaceflight development processes at {LRT}.},

Examining systems engineering literature, this paper presents an assessment of the extent to which benefits and value of {MBSE} are supported by empirical evidence. A systematic review of research and practice papers in major systems engineering archival journals and conference proceedings was conducted. Evidence was categorized in four types, two of which inductively emerged from the results: measured, observed (without a formal measurement process), perceived (claimed without evidence), and backed by other references. Results indicate that two thirds of claimed {MBSE} benefits are only supported by perceived evidence, while only two papers reported measured evidence. The aggregate assessment presented in this paper indicates that claims about the value and benefits of {MBSE} are mainly based on expectation. We argue that evidence supporting the value and benefits of {MBSE} remains inconclusive.},

Decisions at a given level of the architecture decomposition can result in the flowing down of conflicting requirements, which are easy to fulfill in isolation but extremely difficult when dealt with simultaneously. Designing against such sets of requirements considerably limits system affordability. Existing research on the evaluation of such conflicts primarily seek to determine the level of conflicts between pairs of requirements. We assert in this paper that these methods are incomplete and using traditional methodologies can result in missing significant conflicts between groups of requirements. We provide a mathematical proof for this assertion and present two case studies that support the mathematical proof. We present the concept of “order of conflict.” The objective of this paper is to prove why pairwise-based conflicting requirements identification and analysis methods based on pairwise comparisons are flawed.},

We consider applicability of binary file format description languages to specify, parse and verify raw data of the Tunka Advanced Instrument for cosmic rays and Gamma Astronomy ({TAIGA}) experiment. The formal specifications are implemented for five data formats of the experiment and provide automatic generation of source code for data reading libraries in target programming languages (e.g. C++, Java, and Python). These libraries were tested on {TAIGA} data. They showed a good performance and help us to locate the parts with corrupted data.

New synergies will be explored in order to reduce drastically the cost of development, construction, operation and disposal of femto-satellites and mini-launchers for operations in {LEO} (Low Earth Orbits below 300 kilometers of altitude) and short duration, about one week. http://code.google.com/p/moon-20

Two application examples based on current technologies that are not usually space compliance will be shown. The first example pretends to fulfill the N-Prize requirements and it is called {WikiSat}. The second example is an Earth observation application called {EPSCSat}.

The N-Prize is a competition that consists in putting into orbit a satellite of less than 20 grams with less than 10,000 sterling pounds of launch cost. This tiny satellite shall be tracked for at least nine turns around the Earth at a height in excess of 100 kilometers above the ground to qualify for the N-Prize.

The femto-satellite design will be extended to the {EPSCSat} and it is presented as an additional application of this work. The {EPSCSat} is a satellite with a camera, an optic for Earth observation and a fast download link thanks to the use of a radio-link in the S-Band.},

Informed by an extensive review of existing literature, this paper establishes an interdisciplinary focus on the state-of-the-art technologies and compelling opportunities of {ChipSats}. Despite minimal functionality, short orbit lifetimes, and reduced regulation, {ChipSats} offer progression over present capabilities. This research is centered around cross-cutting considerations for the International Space University ({ISU}) to develop and launch {ChipSats} within five years. Existing technologies permit low-functionality payloads, where a 'Sputnik-like' mission with elementary communication functionalities serves as a pertinent precursor for {ISU}'s {ChipSat} mission. The delivery and launch of {ISU}'s own {ChipSat} through the proposed roadmap leans on three pillars: (1) the introduction of an {ISU} {ChipSat} laboratory; (2) regulatory guidance to outline the acceptable boundary conditions for {ChipSat} delivery and operation; and (3) space education and outreach. Technology gaps restrict payload selection, which impedes alternative space-borne applications, and persisting legal hurdles require resolution. A sequence of recommendations addresses these challenges and endorses the development of nanotechnology for component miniaturization.},

Constrained by the energy/volume capacity, traditional attitude actuators no longer suit the {PCBSat}. In the paper, employing the flexible {PCB} material and micro-steppers, a new design that enables the {PCBSat} to fold and unfold is proposed, and a prototype is manufactured. The foldable {PCBSat} could achieve attitude maneuver by the spatial multibody dynamical effect. Meanwhile, the copper coils embedded in the boards can form a 3D magnetorquer when the {PCBSat} is at the orthogonal-fold status, making magnetic de-tumbling possible. Related theories combined with the detailed design of the {PCBSat} are introduced, and simulations are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the attitude control mechanism.},

	abstract = {Asteroid mining has been proposed as an approach to complement Earth-based supplies of rare earth metals and to supply resources in space, such as water. However, existing studies on the economic viability of asteroid mining do not provide much guidance on which technological improvements would be needed for increasing its economic viability. This paper develops a techno-economic analysis of asteroid mining with the objective of providing basic recommendations for future technology development and performance improvements. Both, providing water in space as well as returning platinum to Earth are considered. Starting from first principles of techno-economic analysis, gradually additional economic and technological factors are added to the analysis model. Applied to mining missions involving spacecraft reuse, learning curve effect, and multiple spacecraft, their economic viability is assessed. A sensitivity analysis with respect to throughput rate, spacecraft mass, and resource price is performed. Furthermore, a sample asteroid mining architecture for volatiles based on small {CubeSat}-class spacecraft is presented. It is concluded that key technological drivers for asteroid mining missions are throughput rate, number of spacecraft per mission, and the rate in which successive missions are conducted. Furthermore, for returning platinum to Earth, market reaction strongly influences its economic viability and it seems to be economically viable only under unlikely conditions.},

	abstract = {In our previous paper, we examined the utility of {LEDs} for inter-satellite communication ({ISC}) in multiple small satellite networks and proposed an approach of the physical layer design that meets the requirements of the platform in terms of the critical physical layer design variables. These variables (or parameters) include the {LED} transmit power, photodetector active area, receiver bandwidth and link distance. One of the most important tasks for the visible light communication ({VLC}) system designer is how to ensure the required balance or trade-off among these variables in order to achieve the desired performance. In this work, we employed multi-objective optimization to determine physical layer design variables at which the signal-to-noise ratio ({SNR}) at the {VLC} receiver is maximized. We used the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm {II} ({NSGA}-{II}) in {MATLAB} to determine the Pareto front of two conflicting objective functions, and then extracted the optimal solution using the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution ({TOPSIS}). Analysis of the optimal solution showed that it yielded the maximum {SNR} within the set of non-dominated solutions at the Pareto front. We showed that using multi-objective optimization techniques for assignment of parameter values can yield more than 3 {dB} improvement in the {SNR}.},

This work summarizes ten years of developments, ranging from basic optoelectronic parts and front-end electronics, to different inorbit demonstrations. Several wireless applications were carried out in representative environments at ground level, and on in-flight experiments. A completely wireless satellite will be launched at the beginning of 2010. The benefits of replacing standard data wires and connectors with wireless systems are: mass reduction, flexibility, and simplification of the Assembly, Integration and Tests phases ({AIT}). However, the Aerospace and Defense fields need high reliability solutions. The use of {COTS} (Commercial-Off-The- Shelf) parts in these fields require extensive analyses in order to attain full product assurance. The current commercial optical wireless technology needs a deep transformation in order to be fully applicable in the aforementioned fields. Finally, major breakthroughs for the implementation of optical wireless links in Space will not be possible until dedicated circuits such as mixed analog/digital {ASICs} are developed. Once these products become available, it will also be possible to extend optical wireless links to other applications, such as Unmanned Air and Underwater Vehicles ({UAV} and {UUV}). The steps taken by {INTA} to introduce Optical Wireless Links in the Space environment are presented in this paper.},

	abstract = {{THERE} is a growing trend toward distributed missions for scientific and remote sensing applications where large numbers of satellites are required. Analogous to proliferating terrestrial wireless sensor networks, space sensor networks could provide an unprecedented capability to investigate widespread phenomena. For example, several important space weather missions have yet to be realized due to the present inability to take simultaneous measurements of a phenomenon over a large volume. Space economics and environmental concerns dictate a costeffective mass-producible low-mass satellite for such massively distributed missions in low Earth orbit ({LEO}). An investigation of very small (sub-kilogram) satellite miniaturization techniques has been undertaken, focusing on enabling technologies targeted at space sensor network applications. Existing and emerging very small satellite technologies have been assessed and compared with power generation and payload volume being the key performance metrics. Two novel design methodologies have been developed, simulated, and verified through functional and environmental testing of hardware prototypes. {SpaceChip}, inspired by the satellite-on-a-chip vision, is a monolithic heterogeneous system-on-a-chip ({SoC}) integration approach. 1,2 {PCBSat} is a proposed miniaturization approach, which is based on printed circuit board ({PCB}) substrates. 3 {PCBSat} is focused on deriving the smallest practical satellite within the context of space sensor networks, and constrained to the use of commercial off the shelf ({COTS}) components, processes, and deployment systems.},

The {CSRM} has been submitted to the Object Management Group ({OMG}) as a {CubeSat} specification, and is being evaluated for that role. Mission Engineering, a concept where the mission itself is looked at as a system is being explored as a means to maintain balance between the spacecraft system, operations (including ground systems), and the mission (the integration of needed capabilities). Now opportunities exist to extend the already-developed {CSRM} to enable the application of Mission Engineering to modeling a complete {CubeSat} mission. This paper presents the challenges and approach that the {INCOSE} {SSWG} will address, including a path for extension of the {CRSM} for use in exploring its applicability to the Mission Engineering concept, and capturing the Mission as a Model to create a unifying environment for universities to build on each other's successes as they learn to design for Space.},

To answer these challenges, engineers have always reused their know-how. However, facing today's rising complexity, reuse has to be much more performant. That is why models supported by formal or semiformal languages are preferred to avoid the variability of natural languages interpretation. In this context, model-based systems engineering ({MBSE}) made it possible to change the engineering paradigm by proposing a unique, shared system model. To promote and ease {MBSE} adoption, reuse should be fostered to respect the engineer's working method. A promising method for reusing models is based on the pattern concept. Thus, this article aims to review and evaluate the pattern concept as a means of transferring know-how and fostering reuse in an {MBSE} approach.},

	abstract = {Model Based Systems Engineering ({MBSE}) is an emerging technology that is providing the next advance in modeling and systems engineering. {MBSE} uses Systems Modeling Language ({SysML}) as its modeling language. {SysML} is a domain-specific modeling language for systems engineering used to specify, analyze, design, optimize, and verify systems. An {MBSE} Challenge project was established to model a hypothetical {FireSat} satellite system to evaluate the suitability of {SysML} for describing space systems. Although much was learned regarding modeling of this system, the fictional nature of the {FireSat} system precluded anyone from actually building the satellite. Thus, the practical use of the model could not be demonstrated or verified. This paper reports on using {MBSE} and {SysML} to model a standard {CubeSat} and applying that model to an actual {CubeSat} mission, the Radio Aurora Explorer ({RAX}) mission, developed by the Michigan Exploration Lab ({MXL}) and {SRI} International.},

	abstract = {Fast and reliable high-speed intersatellite communication ({ISC}) between small satellites is dependent on the physical layer ({PL}) design of the onboard communication system. However, as with nonlegacy systems, the lack of architecture and design information pertaining to the development of the {PL} of an {LED}-based visible light communication ({VLC}) system for {ISC} poses significant challenges to architecting the communication system. Addressing these challenges requires a holistic approach to the specification of the system design. To this end, we explore the use of model-based systems engineering ({MBSE}) principles in mitigating the design complexity of the {PL} architecture for the {VLC} system. Design concerns and gaps are addressed by developing an executable black-box system model that specifies the conceptual architecture of the system, and a parametric model that analyzes multiple system configurations based on generated values for the signal-to-noise ratio and bit error rate parameters. We utilize the structural, behavioral, and parametric semantics of {SysML} to define, specify, visualize, and analyze the various system design configurations. The resulting {PL} black-box system specification is verified through model execution.},

Within the systems engineering community, there has been a realization that organizations optimize individual systems performance and manage system-specific cost, schedule and risks, with comparatively little regard to the holistic System-of-Systems ({SOS}) context. Optimization of individual satellite and homogeneous constellation design parameters have been well documented in literature. We expand extant techniques to the larger {SoS} context, with the potential to realize efficiencies by synthesizing and evaluating a larger design space. Using genetic algorithms, the method models a disaggregate space system as a combinatorial optimization problem. The combination of potential large satellites and small satellites are evaluated for cost effectiveness. Cost coefficients are derived from a variety of cost models, and overall effectiveness of a design alternative is provided through integrated simulation and optimization routines. We apply the proposed method to determine the optimal mix of space-based systems in an example remote sensing earth observation scenario.},

	title = {Heritage Technologies in Space Programs - Assessment Methodology and Statistical Analysis},
	url = {https://mediatum.ub.tum.de/node?id=1308879&change_language=en},
	abstract = {An established approach to cost and risk reduction in system development programs is the use of heritage technologies. A heritage technology is defined as a proven technology, reused in a new use context, in an unaltered or adapted form. Heritage technologies are particularly relevant for space systems development programs, as their development costs are usually high and stakeholders risk-averse. Nevertheless, numerous space programs encountered problems linked to improper ‘management’ of heritage technologies when reused, i.e., improper use, implementation or adaptation. Improperly managed heritage technologies can lead to cost and schedule overruns, or even failure in the reuse application. Currently, the applicability of heritage technologies is mostly assessed ad-hoc. The existing assessment approaches are deemed to be insufficient for providing decision-makers and analysts with ample guidance on the applicability of heritage technologies. 
This thesis presents a methodology for assessing heritage technologies in the early phases of development, taking the new use context of the technology, its necessary adaptations and modifications, as well as technological capabilities of the implementing organization into consideration. For illuminating the relationship between the use of heritage technologies and the performance of space programs empirically, a statistical analysis is performed.
The methodology focuses on the early phases, where most of the technology selection takes place. A 3-component framework is developed that serves as the theoretical basis for the statistical analysis and the methodology. The framework consists of a systems architecting framework, a technology framework, and a verification, validation, testing, and operation framework. 
Based on the concepts developed in the framework, a statistical analysis is performed. Using multiple regression with control variables, a statistically significant relationship between heritage technology and specific development cost / development duration was confirmed. No statistically significant relationship between heritage use and development cost overrun / schedule overrun could be identified.
Based on the framework and results from the statistical analysis, a methodology for assessing heritage technologies in the early phases is developed. It allows for identifying potential compliance issues of the heritage technology with respect to changed needs and requirements. Estimating the impact of modifications is performed via design structure matrices and a graph-edit-similarity algorithm. Furthermore, a heritage metric is presented that can be used for measuring heritage with respect to a new application. Finally, the methodology also allows for assessing technological and organizational capabilities. 
The methodology is validated by three space system case studies: 1) a {CubeSat} component technology, 2) a high-pressure tank technology for the Ariane 5 launcher, and 3) the Saturn V and Space Launch System technology. 
From the presented work it can be concluded that the methodology can be systematically applied to various types of space systems at different levels of decomposition. The heritage metric provides a rough estimate of heritage of a technology for a new application and context. The statistical analysis confirmed that in general using heritage technologies significantly reduces specific development cost and development duration. As future work, the developed methodology could be extended to other domains such as automotive engineering, aeronautics, and medical engineering, where heritage also plays an important role.},

	abstract = {The early Conceptual Design ({CD}) of a Space Access System ({SAS}) is the most abstract, innovative, and technologically challenging phase throughout the entire aerospace product development life-cycle. It is the most important life-cycle phase which influences around 80 percent of the overall life-cycle-cost and ironically it is also the least understood
phase. The history of space access vehicle design provides numerous examples of projects that failed due to the lack of a proper technology-hardware-mission assessment in the {CD} phase.
The current dissertation addressees this crucial phase and develops a best-practice solution process to advance the current state of the art of the {CD} oriented vehicle design synthesis systems. The solution is a generic process that can be applied to all categories of the {SAS}. The Vertical-Takeoff Horizontal-Landing type {SAS} is selected as the demonstration case-study for the solution process.
The research provides a proof of concept for how the proposed solution process expands the scope and application of current applications of the {CD} assessment vertically across the {SAS} system's hierarchy and horizontally across the lifecycle phases of the {SAS}.},

	abstract = {The number of small- and nano-satellites being launched into orbit is expected to continue to grow in the coming years. In order to avoid the creation of space debris,spacecraft developers have to take action in order to reduce the severity of space debris. A widely used guideline is to ensure that no space system is left in the Low Earth Orbit environment for more than 25 years after the end of mission. Given this guideline, this thesis investigates 1U, 2U and 3U {CubeSats} in Low Earth Orbit using the General Mission Analysis Tool ({GMAT}) in order to determine the maximum allowable value of the semi-major axis so that the 25 year limit is met. This analysis results in orbital decay diagrams which can be used by {CubeSat} developers in order to evaluate different orbits early in the design phase.

These findings are then applied to the {AcubeSAT} mission in order to perform an orbital analysis tailored to the mission. {AcubeSAT} is a 3U {CubeSat} that is currently being designed by students in the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki with the support of the Education Office of the European Space Agency, under the educational Fly Your Satellite! programme. The objective of {AcubeSAT}’s mission is to probe the expression of eukaryotic genes in the environment of Low Earth Orbit. {AcubeSAT}’s design calls for a very specific orientation to be achieved in order to downlink all images to the ground segment. This orientation is evaluated using the theory of spin-orbit coupling to determine if this orientation can be maintained in the event of a failure in the Attitude Determination \& Control Subsystem of the spacecraft. Based on the findings, an alternative design solution is also proposed.},

Unfortunately, limited on-orbit failure data and statistical analyses of satellite reliability exist in the literature. To fill this gap, we recently conducted a nonparametric analysis of satellite reliability for 1584 Earth-orbiting satellites launched between January 1990 and October 2008. In this paper, we extend our statistical analysis of satellite reliability and investigate satellite subsystems reliability. Because our dataset is censored, we make extensive use of the Kaplan–Meier estimator for calculating the reliability functions. We derive confidence intervals for the nonparametric reliability results for each subsystem and conduct parametric fits with Weibull distributions using the maximum likelihood estimation ({MLE}) approach. We finally conduct a comparative analysis of subsystems failure, identifying the “culprit subsystems” that drive satellite unreliability. The results here presented should prove particularly useful to the space industry for example in redesigning subsystem test and screening programs, or providing an empirical basis for redundancy allocation.},

Although particles inducing total ionizing dose ({TID}) can be effectively shielded against in {LEO}, particles responsible for Single Event Effects ({SEEs}) remain an issue for the reliability of electronics. This is particularly of concern considering the increasing use of Commercial-Off-The-Shelf ({COTS}) components, not designed for space applications.

	abstract = {New requirements on post-accident monitoring systems in nuclear power plants pose fresh challenges for electronic system designers and nuclear power plant personnel, in particular, on how radiation can potentially affect the electronics in such systems; and how one can deal with such effects. In fact, study on radiation effects on electronic devices, effective design techniques to reduce such impacts, as well as simulation tools and design aids, has spanned for many decades. As a result, there is vast literature on the subject scattered in many places and in various forms, which inadvertently makes it difficult for non-specialists, such as an electronic engineer, to obtain relevant information effectively. The objective of the current paper is to provide a high-level overview in an organized fashion to guide readers to right literature for more detailed study on a specific topic in this area. The paper consists of three logically connected parts: radiation effects on electronics; design techniques to minimize such effects; and modeling and simulation tools available. For each part, a brief introduction of key issues is described first followed by a list of key references. In total, 336 references have been assembled to provide a comprehensive coverage on this subject.},

There are a myriad of quality and reliability tools available to corporations worldwide, but the one that shows up consistently in company after company is Failure Mode and Effects Analysis ({FMEA}). Effective {FMEAs} takes the best practices from hundreds of companies and thousands of {FMEA} applications and presents streamlined procedures for veteran {FMEA} practitioners, novices, and everyone in between.

Written from an applications viewpoint—with many examples, detailed case studies, study problems, and tips included—the book covers the most common types of {FMEAs}, including System {FMEAs}, Design {FMEAs}, Process {FMEAs}, Maintenance {FMEAs}, Software {FMEAs}, and others. It also presents chapters on Fault Tree Analysis, Design Review Based on Failure Mode ({DRBFM}), Reliability-Centered Maintenance ({RCM}), Hazard Analysis, and {FMECA} (which adds criticality analysis to {FMEA}).

With extensive study problems and a companion Solutions Manual, this book is an ideal resource for academic curricula, as well as for applications in industry. In addition, Effective {FMEAs} covers:

    The basics of {FMEAs} and risk assessment

    How to apply key factors for effective {FMEAs} and prevent the most common errors

    What is needed to provide excellent {FMEA} facilitation

    Implementing a "best practice" {FMEA} process

The biodisplay was designed to prevent release of chemical or biological material to avoid environmental contamination.

Such platforms are being used for several space applications, such as education, Earth remote sensing, science, and defense. As of May 31st, 2018, 855 {CubeSats} had been launched. Remote sensing application is the main sector in which {CubeSats} are being used, corresponding to about 45\% of all applications. This fact indicates the commercial potential of such a platform. Fifty eight countries have already been involved with developing {CubeSats}. The most used {CubeSat} configuration is 3U (about 64\%), followed by 1U (18\%), while 6U platforms account for about 4\%. In this paper, we present an analysis of the current situation regarding {CubeSats} worldwide, through the use of a dataset built to encompass information about these satellites. The overall success rate of the {CubeSat} missions is increasing over time. Moreover, considering {CubeSat} missions as a Bernoulli experiment, and excluding launch failures, the current success rate was estimated, as a parameter of a binomial distribution, to be about 75\%. By using a logistic model and considering that the launchings keep following the current tendency, one can expect that one thousand {CubeSats} will be launched in 2021, within 95\% certainty.},

	shorttitle = {Failures in Spacecraft System},
	abstract = {Space mission-related projects are demanding and risky undertakings because of their complexity and cost. Many missions have failed over the years due to anomalies in either the launch vehicle or the spacecraft. Projects of such magnitude with undetected flaws due to ineffective process controls run into unwarranted cost, schedule overruns and account for huge losses. Such failures continue to occur despite the studies on systems engineering process deficiencies and the best systems engineering practices in place. To understand the reasons behind such failures, this work analyses some of the major contributing factors behind majority of space mission technical failures. To achieve this objective, we analyzed the failure data of space missions that happened over the last decade. Based on that information, we analyzed the launch-related failure events from a design decision-making perspective by employing failure event chain-based framework. By analyzing the failure events with this framework, we identify some dominant cognitive biases that might have impacted the overall system performance leading to unintended catastrophes. The ability of any design team to achieve optimal performance is limited by communication and knowledge deficiencies between highly dissimilar subsystems. These inefficiencies work to bias each subsystem engineer to prioritize the utility provided by the subsystem they are responsible for. In order to understand how engineering design decisions are influenced by the presence of cognitive biases, the second part of this study establishes a mathematical framework for utility-based selection based on Cumulative Prospect Theory. This framework captures the effect of cognitive biases on selection of alternatives by a rational decision-maker.From the first study, overconfidence and anchoring biases are identified as the two dominant contributing factors that influenced the decisions behind majority of the failures. The theoretical models developed in the second study are employed to depict the influence of biased decision-making on utility-based selection of alternatives for an earth-orbiting satellite's power subsystem. Predictions from these models show a direct correlation between the decision-maker's biased preference structure and local change in utility curve depicting the (negative) influence of cognitive biases on decision-maker's choice(s).},

	abstract = {The purpose of this report is to determine the failure rate of small-satellite missions launched between the years 2000 and 2016. This analysis considers the rates of both partial and total mission failure, as well as the failures attributable to failure of the launch vehicle. This study observed that between the years of 2000 to 2016, 41.3\% of all small satellites launched failed or partially failed. Of these small satellite missions, 24.2\% were total mission failures, another 11\% were partial mission failures, and 6.1\% were launch vehicle failures. The small satellite failure data reveals an increase in the failure rate as the yearly launch rate has increased. The period 2000 to 2008 averaged 15 launches per year, during which 28.6\% of the small satellite missions failed or partially failed. The period from 2009 to 2016 averaged 48 launches per year, during which 42.6\% of the small satellite missions failed or partially failed. The launch vehicle failure rate for both periods was the same at around 6.1\%. The implication is that for modern small satellite missions, almost one out of every two small satellite missions will result in either a total or a partial mission failure. Counting the partial mission successes as “successful missions” reduces the failure rate, but only to 38.2\% for the period 2009 to 2016.},

	abstract = {Traditionally, the space industry produced large and sophisticated spacecraft handcrafted by large teams of engineers and budgets within the reach of only a few large government-backed institutions. However, over the last decade, the space industry experienced an increased interest towards smaller missions and recent advances in commercial-off-the-shelf ({COTS}) technology miniaturization spurred the development of small spacecraft missions based on the {CubeSat} standard. {CubeSats} were initially envisioned primarily as educational tools or low cost technology demonstration platforms that could be developed and launched within one or two years. Recently, however, more advanced {CubeSat} missions have been developed and proposed, indicating that {CubeSats} clearly started to transition from being solely educational and technology demonstration platforms to offer opportunities for low-cost real science missions with potential high value in terms of science return and commercial revenue. Despite the significant progress made in {CubeSat} research and development over the last decade, some fundamental questions still habitually arise about the {CubeSat} capabilities, limitations, and ultimately about their scientific and commercial value. The main objective of this review is to evaluate the state of the art {CubeSat} capabilities with a special focus on advanced scientific missions and a goal of assessing the potential of {CubeSat} platforms as capable spacecraft. A total of over 1200 launched and proposed missions have been analyzed from various sources including peer-reviewed journal publications, conference proceedings, mission webpages as well as other publicly available satellite databases and about 130 relatively high performance missions were downselected and categorized into six groups based on the primary mission objectives including “Earth Science and Spaceborne Applications”, “Deep Space Exploration”, “Heliophysics: Space Weather”, “Astrophysics”, “Spaceborne In Situ Laboratory”, and “Technology Demonstration” for in-detail analysis. Additionally, the evolution of {CubeSat} enabling technologies are surveyed for evaluating the current technology state of the art as well as identifying potential areas that will benefit the most from further technology developments for enabling high performance science missions based on {CubeSat} platforms.},

Being these applications are based on components with low {TRL} (Technology Readiness Level) or with limited performance data, it is required to define approaches which ensure a systematic perspective. This paper aims to present a reliability engineering approach based on {FMECA} (Failure Mode, Effects, and Criticality Analysis) to manage {CubeSat} reliability data and prioritize criticalities early in the design phase. The approach firstly proposes an alpha-numeric coding system to support the identification and labeling of failure modes for typical {CubeSats}\&rsquo; items. Subsequently, each {FMECA} coefficient (i.e., Severity, Occurrence, Detectability) has been linked to the {CubeSat}\&rsquo;s structural properties, reducing subjectivity by means of techno-centric proxy indicators. The approach has been validated in the design phases of a 6-Units university {CubeSat} for the observation of M-Dwarf stars and binary systems. The performed analysis supported the design process and allowed to identify the major criticalities of the {CubeSat} design, as demonstrated in the extended case study included in the paper. The formalized method could be applied to design procedures for nano-satellites, as well as being expanded for research and development in a variety of space missions.},

	abstract = {New space is a misleading expression. Many new trends steer the evolution of space activities. Development of commercial space, with start-ups and space ventures, is one of the most visible trends in space. Stimulated by the first initiatives related to space tourism, access to space and the growing use of small satellites, space activities have attracted new entrepreneurs, both start-ups and big web actors with substantial investment capacity. This revolution started in the Silicon Valley and spread worldwide. Start-ups have attracted around \$21.8 billion of investment from 2000 to 2018. It is far below the annual institutional budgets but the pace gained momentum since 2006 and specially 2012. Between teenage crisis and age of reason, New space is now old: the first start-ups shall confirm their promises, while new players pop up and try to find their way. It shakes the legacy players but they demonstrate resilience and adaptation capacity. It is now the right time to take stock of the first lessons learnt. Start-ups disrupt the established industry? Instead of a simplistic shortcut, this paper reports an "organizational ecology" study. With a deliberate industrial viewpoint, its ambition is to help understanding complex evolutions in the space ecosystem. The first part of the paper introduces the current ecosystem, its actors, the key trends and the main types of activities. Through facts and figures on technology, investments and markets, the second part reviews how "new space" trends are preparing the advent of big space. The third part summarises lessons from other industries and typical disruption scenarios that could affect space activities. The drivers of New space are discussed in section four. The last part is a foresight exercise, discussing possible evolutions and impacts, threats and opportunities. The decisive role of institutional actors and the new space with more and more space-faring nations is also highlighted. {TSomething} big is happening in space. While it is too early to depict the new landscape, this study shows that the future picture will not be black and white but more colourful. The size and the age of the company are less important than agility, mindset, ability to manage risks and to cooperate. A big vision for the future, from entrepreneurs or from nations, is also needed.},

	abstract = {The space environment is still challenging but is becoming more and more attractive for an increasing number of entities. In the second half of the 20th century, a huge amount of funds was required to build satellites and gain access to space. Nowadays, it is no longer so. The advancement of technologies allows producing very small hardware components able to survive the strict conditions of the outer space. Consequently, small satellites can be designed for a wide set of missions keeping low design times, production costs, and deployment costs. One widely used type of small satellite is the {CubeSat}, whose different aspects are surveyed in the following: mission goals, hardware subsystems and components, possible network topologies, channel models, and suitable communication protocols. We also show some future challenges related to the employment of {CubeSat} networks.},

	abstract = {Byte stuffing is a process that transforms a sequence of data bytes that may contain 'illegal' or 'reserved' values into a potentially longer sequence that contains no occurrences of those values. The extra length is referred to in this paper as the overhead of the algorithm.To date, byte stuffing algorithms, such as those used by {SLIP} [{RFC}1055], {PPP} [{RFC}1662] and {AX}.25 [{ARRL}84], have been designed to incur low average overhead but have made little effort to minimize worst case overhead.Some increasingly popular network devices, however, care more about the worst case. For example, the transmission time for {ISM}-band packet radio transmitters is strictly limited by {FCC} regulation. To adhere to this regulation, the practice is to set the maximum packet size artificially low so that no packet, even after worst case overhead, can exceed the transmission time limit.This paper presents a new byte stuffing algorithm, called Consistent Overhead Byte Stuffing ({COBS}), that tightly bounds the worst case overhead. It guarantees in the worst case to add no more than one byte in 254 to any packet. Furthermore, the algorithm is computationally cheap, and its average overhead is very competitive with that of existing algorithms.},

	abstract = {{ESA} has developed standards for packet telemetry and telecommand, which are derived from the recommendations of the Inter-Agency Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems ({CCSDS}). These standards are now mandatory for future {ESA} programs as well as for many programs currently under development. However, while these packet standards address the end-to-end transfer of telemetry and telecommand data between
applications on the ground and Application Processes on-board, they leave open the internal structure or content of the packets. This paper presents the {ESA} Packet Utilization Standard ({PUS}) which addresses this very subject and, as such, serves to extend and complement the {ESA} packet standards. The goal of the {PUS} is to be applicable to future {ESA} missions in all application areas (Telecommunications, Science, Earth Resources, microgravity, etc.). The production of the {PUS} falls under the responsibility of the {ESA} Committee for Operations and {EGSE}

None of them deal with space system synthesis – with the interrelations between all the elements of the space system. Introduction to Space Systems concentrates on understanding the interaction between all the forces, both technical and non-technical, which influence the definition of a space system. This book refers to the entire system: space and ground segments, mission objectives as well as to cost, risk, and mission success probabilities. Introduction to Space Systems is divided into two parts. The first part analyzes the process of space system design in an abstract way. The second part of the book focuses on concrete aspects of the space system design process. It concentrates on interactions between design decisions and uses past design examples to illustrate these interactions. The idea is for the reader to acquire a good insight in what is a good design by analyzing these past designs.},

	abstract = {While there is no rigorous framework to develop nanosatellites flight software, this manuscript aimed to explore and establish processes to design a reliable and reusable flight software architecture for cost-efficient student Cubesat missions such as Masat-1. Masat-1 is a 1Unit {CubeSat}, developed using a systems engineering approach, off-the-shelf components and open-source software tools. It was our aim to use it as a test-bed platform and as an initial reference for Cubesat flight software development in Morocco. The command and data handling system chosen for Masat-1 is a system-on-module-embedded computer running {freeRTOS}. A real-time operating system was used in order to simplify the real-time onboard management. To ensure software design reliability, modularity, reusability and extensibility, our solution follows a layered service oriented architectural pattern, and it is based on a finite state machine in the application layer to execute the mission functionalities in a deterministic manner. Moreover, a client-server model was elected to ensure the inter-process communication and resources access while using uniform {APIs} to enhance cross-platform data exchange. A hierarchical fault tolerance architecture was also implemented after a systematic assessment of the Masat-1 mission risks using reliability block diagrams ({RBDs}) and functional failure mode, effect and criticality analysis ({FMECA}).},

Using Maximum Likelihood Estimation, a Single Weibull and a 2-Weibull mixture parametric model are fitted to the non-parametric data. Furthermore, by combining developers’ beliefs on several reliability aspects from a survey conducted in late 2014 with data from past missions, we make a first attempt to correlate space engineering “best guesses” and intuition to actual data. Finally, the probabilistic {CubeSat} reliability estimation tool is introduced as a method to reduce the infant mortality of {CubeSats}: {CubeSat} developers should be able to estimate their required functional testing time on subsystem and system level at an early project stage, while targeting a desired reliability goal on their {CubeSat}.},

It provides recommendations for a future {CubeSat} bus standard. The survey is based on a literature study and a questionnaire representing 60 launched {CubeSats} and 44 to be launched {CubeSats}. It is found that the bus interfaces are not the main driver for mission failures. However, it is concluded that the Inter Integrated Circuit (I2C) data bus, as implemented in a great majority of the {CubeSats}, caused some catastrophic satellite failures and a vast amount of bus lockups. The power distribution may lead to catastrophic failures if the power lines are not protected against overcurrent. A connector and wiring standard widely implemented in {CubeSats} is based on the {PC}/104 standard. Most participants find the 104 pin connector of this standard too large. For a future {CubeSat} bus interface standard, it is recommended to implement a reliable data bus, a power distribution with overcurrent protection and a wiring harness with smaller connectors compared with {PC}/104.},

	abstract = {Lean satellite programs are programs in which the satellite development philosophy is driven by fast delivery and low cost. Though this concept offers the possibility to develop and fly risky missions without jeopardizing a space program, most of these satellites suffer infant mortality and fail to achieve their mission minimum success. Lean satellites with high infant mortality rate indicate that testing prior to launch is insufficient. In this study, the authors monitored failures occurring during the development of the lean satellite {HORYU}-{IV} to identify the evolution of the cumulative number of failures against cumulative testing time. Moreover, the sub-systems driving the failures depending on the different development phases were identified. The results showed that half to 2/3 of the failures are discovered during the early stage of testing. Moreover, when the mean time before failure was calculated, it appeared that for any development phase considered, a new failure appears on average every 20h of testing. Simulations were also performed and it showed that for an initial testing time of 50h, reliability after 1 month launch can be improved by nearly 6 times as compared to an initial testing time of 20h. Through this work, the authors aim at providing a qualitative reference for lean satellites developers to better help them manage resources to develop lean satellites following a fast delivery and low cost philosophy while ensuring sufficient reliability to achieve mission minimum success.},

	abstract = {The {SatNOGS}, or Satellite Network Open Ground Stations, project promotes and supports free and open space applications. It seeks to address the problem of connecting many satellite users/observers to many ground station operators. Modern Open Source software, web, and hardware techniques are used in implementing the Network, Database, Client, and Ground Station sub-projects. Modularity in all the systems promotes the dual-use of ground stations by not interfering with local operation while utilizing the great amount of time a civilian, non-commercial ground station would otherwise sit idle.},

	title = {Orbital analysis and the spin-orbit coupling for the {AcubeSAT} mission},
	abstract = {The number of small- and nano-satellites being launched into orbit is expected to continue to grow in the coming years. In order to avoid the creation of space debris,spacecraft developers have to take action in order to reduce the severity of space debris. A widely used guideline is to ensure that no space system is left in the Low Earth Orbit environment for more than 25 years after the end of mission. Given this guideline, this thesis investigates 1U, 2U and 3U {CubeSats} in Low Earth Orbit using the General Mission Analysis Tool ({GMAT}) in order to determine the maximum allowable value of the semi-major axis so that the 25 year limit is met. This analysis results in orbital decay diagrams which can be used by {CubeSat} developers in order to evaluate different orbits early in the design phase. These findings are then applied to the {AcubeSAT} mission in order to perform an orbital analysis tailored to the mission. {AcubeSAT} is a 3U {CubeSat} that is currently being designed by students in the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki with the support of the Education Office of the European Space Agency, under the educational Fly Your Satellite! programme. The objective of {AcubeSAT}’s mission is to probe the expression of eukaryotic genes in the environment of Low Earth Orbit. {AcubeSAT}’s design calls for a very specific orientation to be achieved in order to downlink all images to the ground segment. This orientation is evaluated using the theory of spin-orbit coupling to determine if this orientation can be maintained in the event of a failure in the Attitude Determination \& Control Subsystem of the spacecraft. Based on the findings, an alternative design solution is also proposed.},

	abstract = {The correct operation of complex critical systems increasingly relies on the ability to detect and recover from faults. The design of Fault Detection, Isolation and Recovery ({FDIR}) sub-systems is highly challenging, due to the complexity of the underlying system, the number of faults to be considered and their dynamics. Existing industrial practices for {FDIR} are often based on ad-hoc solutions, that are conceived and developed late in the design process, and do not consider the software- and system-level {RAMS} analyses data (e.g., {FTA} and {FMEA}). In this paper we propose the {FAME} process: a novel, model-based, integrated process for {FDIR} design, that addresses the shortcomings of existing practices. This process aims at enabling a consistent and timely {FDIR} conception, development, veriﬁcation and validation. The process is supported by the {FAME} environment, a model-based toolset that encompasses a wide range of formal analyses, and supports the {FDIR} design by providing functionality to deﬁne mission and {FDIR} requirements, fault propagation modeling, and automated synthesis of {FDIR} models. The {FAME} process and environment have been developed within an {ESA}-funded study, and have been thoroughly evaluated by the industrial partners on a case study derived from the {ExoMars} project.},

	abstract = {Under constrained budgets and rigid schedules, {NASA} and industry have greatly increased their utilization of small satellites to conduct low-cost planetary investigations. Recent failed small planetary science spacecraft such as Mars Polar Lander ({MPL}) and Mars Climate Orbiter ({MCO}), and impaired missions such as Mars Global Surveyor ({MGS}) have fueled the ongoing debate on whether {NASA}'s “Faster, Better, Cheaper” ({FBC}) approach is working. Several noteworthy failures of earth-orbiting missions have occurred as well including Lewis and the Wide-field Infrared Experiment ({WIRE}). While recent studies have observed that {FBC} has resulted in lower costs and shorter development times, these benefits may have been achieved at the expense of lowering probability of success. One question remaining to be answered is when is a mission “too fast and too cheap” that it is prone to failure? This paper assesses {NASA} {FBC} missions in terms of a complexity index measured against development time and spacecraft cost. A comparison of relative failure rates of recent planetary and earth-orbiting missions are presented, and conclusions regarding dependence on system complexity are drawn.},

	abstract = {Fault-tolerance analysis reveals possible system behavior under the influence of faults. Such analysis is essential for satellites where faults might be caused by space radiation and autonomous recovery is needed. In this paper we present a statistical simulation approach for fault-tolerance analysis of satellite On-Board Computers ({OBCs}) that are based on Commercial Off-The-Shelf ({COTS}) components. Since the logic level of {COTS} electronics is unknown to satellite designers, a new higher-level fault-tolerance analysis is required. We propose such technique that relies on {OBC} modeling and fault modeling, based on the modeling principle of Single-Event Upsets ({SEUs}). For the first time we can compare the efficiency of fault-tolerance techniques implemented in software and Field-Programmable Gate Array ({FPGA}). In addition, our approach enables to analyze system fault-tolerance at early development stages. In a case study the approach is applied to an {OBC} with a Microsemi {SmartFusion} {SoC}, that executes a satellite attitude control algorithm. The gained statistical simulation results enabled 50\% reduction in the hardware overhead of the implemented memory scrubbing technique without loss in fault-tolerance. Our method revealed critical fault-tolerance drawbacks of the initial system design that could have lead to satellite mission failure.},

	abstract = {Multicellular system architectures are proposed as a solution to the problem of low reliability currently seen amongst small, low cost satellites. In a multicellular architecture, a set of independent k-out-of-n systems mimic the cells of a biological organism. In order to be beneficial, a multicellular architecture must provide more reliability per unit of overhead than traditional forms of redundancy. The overheads include power consumption, volume and mass. This paper describes the derivation of an analytical model for predicting a multicellular system's lifetime. The performance of such architectures is compared against that of several common forms of redundancy and proven to be beneficial under certain circumstances. In addition, the problem of peripheral interfaces and cross-strapping is investigated using a purpose-developed, multicellular simulation environment. Finally, two case studies are presented based on a prototype cell implementation, which demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed architecture.},

	abstract = {In this study, a novel reliability-corrected cost model for estimating the development cost of highly agile small {EO} (Earth Observation) satellites is presented. In order to develop the cost model of highly agile small {EO} satellites, a database has been constructed consisting of 49 satellites carrying electro-optical payloads and having a launch mass between 100kg and 1,000kg that have either been developed or being developed within a time frame from 1991 to 2011. The cost model of top-down type was developed by analyzing the database statistically. The reliability-corrected {CER} (Cost Estimating Relationships) developed in this study implement multiple parameters-based complexity indexes. In addition, the Cost Correction Factor ({CCF}) and Low Cost Small Satellite ({LCSS}) adjustment factor were newly introduced as additional parameters for cost estimation. The reliability-corrected {CERs} for 26 {EO} satellites were used for verification of the cost model developed in this study. It was observed that there are approximately 7\% of absolute average errors in the reliability-corrected {CER}. It is concluded that this cost model can provide cost estimates with a higher accuracy, as compared to conventional cost models such as {USCM} and {SSCM}. Finally, this paper also describes the results of cost estimation obtained by applying the developed cost model to highly agile small electro-optical satellites having specific performance requirements.},

The {FDIR} challenges range from pre-design and design stages for upcoming and new programs, to improvement of the performance of in-service flying systems. For space missions, optimization of flight conditions and safe operation is intrinsically related to {GNC} (Guidance, Navigation \& Control) system of the spacecraft and includes sensors and actuators monitoring. Many future space missions will require autonomous proximity operations including fault diagnosis and the subsequent control and guidance recovery actions. For upcoming and future aircraft, one of the main issues is how early and robust diagnosis of some small and subtle faults could contribute to the overall optimization of aircraft design. This issue would be an important factor for anticipating the more and more stringent requirements which would come in force for future environmentally-friendlier programs. The paper underlines the reasons for a widening gap between the advanced scientific {FDIR} methods being developed by the academic community and technological solutions demanded by the aerospace industry.},

	abstract = {The avionics architecture of in-orbit infrastructure elements is driven by safety. Safety of the crew inside the Columbus Orbital Facility ({COF}) laboratory module, safety of the Space Station as a whole for the automated transfer vehicle ({ATV}) when performing a rendezvous manoeuvre. The design answers on safety requirements, methods and tools used for the development stem from a common concept. The paper first describes the {COF} Data Management System architecture, basically organised in two layers with a strict hierarchical relationship. The vital layer is in charge of {COF} initial activation, safety supervision and emergency modes management. The nominal layer is a distributed system, organised around a local area Ethernet network. Under normal conditions, it is in charge of its own fault management supported by management agents distributed in the system. Fault detection criteria are derived from an {FMECA} (failure mode, effect and criticality analysis) and also from a {SEEA} (software error effect analysis). Recovery actions are allocated to various decision levels in the hierarchy depending on their time criticality. In {ATV}, the same principles apply, but the implementation is adapted to the peculiarities of an automated vehicle. The nominal layer, because of the time constraints bearing upon any reconfiguration, implements fault masking (majority voting) instead of fault detection and recovery.The vital layer is allocated the very critical task of monitoring the spacecraft attitude and velocity, and performing if necessary a collision avoidance manoeuvre. An end-to-end comprehensive methodology is put in place to be able to demonstrate the compliance of the systems to technical, product assurance and safety requirements.},
